    "question": "What is the Difference Between Medical and Social Surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Surrogacy is commonly categorized into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While legal parentage considerations often drive this distinction, many Intended Parents mistakenly believe they can only pursue surrogacy for a “medical need.” But, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we strongly support all Intended Parents in their journey to grow their families, and appreciate a wide array of reasons for doing so — whether those reasons are medical in nature, or not. Surrogacy is typically classified into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While some assume surrogacy is only available for medical reasons, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we believe every Intended Parent deserves support in their efforts to build a family.",

I found that I have always enjoyed helping others and when I had my children, I knew that Obstetrics was where I was supposed to be. I have now been a nurse for six years. I knew that God wanted me to be the support person for women and families experiencing the joy and heartbreak of labor and delivery. Kristina: I have had the honor of being a nurse for eighteen years and a nurse practitioner for five years. Prior to becoming a nurse, I had worked for an insurance company processing health and dental claims and then for two additional companies in health information technology. While I enjoyed my work, I felt a strong pull to become a nurse, to give of myself and to make a difference in someone’s life. Nicole: Growing up the oldest in my family, I was always looking out and taking care of my younger brothers. I have always shown compassion and empathy and enjoy helping others.

It will also likely direct the hospital to release the child to the intended parents after discharge and order the state’s Office of Vital Records to name the intended parents on the child’s birth certificate.What does post-birth mean?The post-birth process is overall procedurally the same as the pre-birth, but it occurs after the child is born. Often this is because the relevant state law contemplates the existence of a live child before anything can be filed or entered. But the ultimate result is the same – a birth certificate with the intended parents’ names and secure legal parentage of the child in favor of the intended parents.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the legal risks?",
    "answer": "A common concern amongst intended parents when discussing pre-versus post-birth is whether there is a greater legal risk associated with the post-birth process; i.e., can the gestational carrier decide to keep the baby? In a word, no. ConceiveAbilities will only match intended parents and gestational carriers in a state that supports their respective rights. As the pregnant person, the gestational carrier will have standing to object to the process, whether in a pre- OR a post-birth state. But in either case and what really matters, is that such an objection would be a losing argument. The gestational carrier will have no genetic relationship to the child, there will be a gestational carrier agreement outlining the parties’ rights and responsibilities, and affidavits from doctors and lawyers proving that the intended parents are entitled to legal parentage. Additionally, there will be other documents in place, such as a HIPAA release and power of attorney, ensuring that the intended parents may make all medical decisions for the child and that the child is discharged into their care.On the flip side, a common concern amongst gestational carriers is what happens if the intended parents do not take the baby; do I become responsible? Again, the answer is no. The gestational carrier agreement protects the gestational carrier from any legal or medical responsibility for the child. We encourage you to not focus on whether the legal parentage will occur pre- versus post-birth because, in either circumstance, the intended parents’ legal rights will be secured, and their names will end up on the child’s birth certificate; it is truly a question of when it procedurally occurs.",

    "answer": "Every state has different surrogacy laws and legal precedents. New York recently enacted the Gestational Surrogates’ Bill of Rights, the gold standard of surrogate rights. It ensures gestational surrogates are aware of their rights as they relate to their health and welfare, right to independent legal counsel, health insurance and medical costs, life insurance and contract termination protections.",

    "question": "What is the Legal Difference in Types of Surrogacy?",
    "answer": "First, it’s important to address the different types of surrogacy. While it’s rarely practiced today – and in many states, it’s illegal – traditional (genetic) surrogacy still exists. This means that the surrogate’s own egg is used, making her the child’s genetic mother. It can invite many potential legal and other complications, which is why few intended parents choose this route and is not a type of surrogacy offered by ConceiveAbilities. In the more common gestational surrogacy arrangement, and the arrangement that ConceiveAbilities work with exclusively, the surrogate undergoes In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and carries a child that is genetically related to the intended parents or donor(s). With a proper legal contract in place to protect all parties, gestational surrogacy arrangements are the safest route.",

    "question": "What is surrogate milk donation?",
    "answer": "After giving birth, the surrogate may choose to extend their surrogacy journey and pump breast milk for the surrobabe. This is a common part of the surrogacy process and can range from the first part of the child’s life and some even extend the amount of time they pump for their Intended Family. Some parents know they would like to have a surrogate pump before their surrogacy journey begins, while others make the decision during the surrogacy process, or choose not to have the surrogate pump for them. Any agreement the surrogate and intended family makes will be included, or amended, in the surrogacy agreement. If the Intended Parents do not wish for the surrogate to pump, she can donate her breast milk to a milk bank or she may choose to suppress lactation, more commonly known as drying up her milk supply.",

We’re looking at people as a whole ecosystem. So it’s not just all of the organ systems of your body, but it’s also the environment that you’ve been in, any exposures that you’ve had from environmental toxins or genetic discrepancies. We also look a lot at people’s experience of the world, including any kind of trauma or events that have happened to them. We start basically peeling back the layers to figure out what the actual cause is of a particular health issue.",

Anytime that your body alignment is not correct, you may actually start seeing other systems in your body start to communicate, telling you they’re not doing well either. That’s not always painful. For instance, if somebody has sluggish digestion or constipation, I can address that. We’re looking at the body and how it’s adapting to all of the information that it’s giving the brain and, in return, how the brain is sending that back and changing the function of organs, muscles and joints.",

We want those ligaments going from the tailbone up to the uterus to be very symmetrical and stable. We balance out the piriformis muscles that run across your butt cheeks. We work on the front of the belly. Some women, later in pregnancy, will start having round ligament pain. That ligament is unique in that it actually has a muscle fiber running through it. It can have a trigger point in it that causes a lot of pain similar to what you get in your upper back. The Webster technique is focused on a pregnant woman and all about improving her anatomy to create the best environment for the baby to be in. Not every chiropractor is trained in pregnancy, so I encourage women to turn to resources like the International Chiropractic Pediatric Associationto find Webster certified chiropractors.",

I work with women to give them the energy that they need while growing the baby. Our nervous system is going to be key in managing any kind of stress and chiropractic care helps ensure the brain and body are connected and working well together. When a surrogate has little ones at home that she’s taking care of while pregnant, if she’s uncomfortable she’s going to be grumpier because pregnancy can be such a drain on women. When a surrogate is comfortable, that is a huge gift and hopefully she is thinking, “Oh my gosh, this is the best pregnancy I’ve ever had!” That is the feedback that I get often and I want that for every surrogate.",

    "answer": "If an infant is uncomfortable and if they have problems pooping, feeding, or sleeping, those are all indications that a chiropractor can be helpful. Babies have had a stressful event during the birthing process, which impacts their entire body. If a baby is more comfortable, they’re going to feed better, poop with ease and sleep better too! I always tell parents to look at their children to see if their face is symmetrical. If you see one eye too small or closed, that’s going to be an indication that there’s something happening in the head shape that we can change. Also, look for a head tilt. That often can change the way that your child interprets the world. It’s also important that their mouth is opening and closing while feeding. If they’re uncomfortable trying to suck on anything, that’s another indication that a chiropractor could be helpful in getting their palate and their skull structure accustomed to being outside of a body.",

    "answer": "If you love being pregnant, I would definitely investigate. Talk to other surrogates to learn about their experience. The conversations that I’ve had have been extremely valuable because these women have said how much they loved it and how it was such a gift that they would do it again. On a clinical note, I know that a lot of women say they feel best when pregnant and that’s awesome. Somebody who truly enjoys that experience of being pregnant can be a great surrogate. Being a surrogate can be hard, so make sure that you have a community around you who understands your choices! When making this decision, think about the risks, the benefits, and the alternatives. Make sure that this is the best choice for you and your family and then there will be no regrets. You can listen to other people, but tap into yourself and really use that as a guide to decide what would be best for you and your immediate family and go from there.

There’s all these lovely little strategic spots through gestation that I focus on because they’re very important. These acupuncture points vary throughout pregnancy.

    "answer": "Throughout pregnancy, there’s a number of things acupuncture can successfully treat. Morning sickness is a big one. Acupuncture is very beneficial for reducing morning sickness throughout the first trimester. We can change neurotransmitter function and hormone function at different phases in gestation. Pregnancy acupuncture is a really good option for women experiencing depression and anxiety because it’s non-medicated. We’re not worried about putting medications in the body, which could affect the growing baby. In addition, there is an excellent study that came out of Stanford years ago that found acupuncture is more effective at mitigating postpartum depression than medication. So, that’s something that we use acupuncture a lot with. The other thing is we can help facilitate the hormones that go into the activation of labor. If we have conditions where induction is a possibility, we can help move the body along a little bit and perhaps avoid induction. Hypertension is another condition we commonly treat with acupuncture and have good success rates.",

    "answer": "One of the things I find with maternity care in general, and maybe even more so in a surrogate situation, is we focus so much on the health of the baby that we kind of miss the mother. The woman and her health matters during the pregnancy, because if they’re not taking care of themselves and their nutritional status, their health will follow them throughout the rest of their life. This is why caring for mothers is just as important as caring for that baby.",

    "answer": "Acupuncture can help to balance those hormones post pregnancy. One of the big hormone issues we see postpartum is a drop in estrogen and it’s not because the mom doesn’t produce estrogen anymore. It’s because some estrogen was being produced by the baby. So, a postpartum mother has been on an estrogen high for the last several months and then she experiences an estrogen low after the baby’s birth. We can really help her body start to resolve that gap on its own with acupuncture. That’s an example of how acupuncture can play a role in changing hormones and how they are processed.",

They are contributing to giving life and that is really a very deep decision. There are surrogate requirements that a woman has to meet physically and emotionally. For me, age is not as critical because the uterus ages very little, as long as she’s proven to have had a healthy pregnancy. The surrogate will have to pass medical clearances and we do a whole battery of testing, both medically, genetically, and psychologically to make sure that she will have a safe and healthy surrogacy journey. I look at the surrogate’s history from an obstetrical point of view. If she’s had a strong history of pregnancy without complications, then she becomes ideal as a surrogate. It’s not a simple process. There’s a lot of education and there has to be a camaraderie and personal relationship between all of us, so everybody knows exactly what the expectation is. They have to trust who they are working with and that the legal system is all in place.” Read more about surrogate mother requirements.",

You will, of course, have your match manager readily available to answer questions and offer support, along with your Surrogate Sisterhood support group, but that only meets part of the need. From emotional support to everyday logistics such as childcare and housekeeping, it helps to have someone – perhaps a network of people – you can reliably depend on during the year or more of your surrogacy engagement.

This typically means the embryo is creating using the surrogate’s eggs and, perhaps, Intrauterine Insemination (“IUI”) using the father or sperm donor’s sperm. It is not recommended to attempt a pregnancy with a surrogate using her own eggs due to the underlying emotional and legal implications. If the surrogate is also the biological mother, there is a greater risk to all parties. For instance, she could have legal grounds to challenge custody or could, conversely, be left with medical and financial responsibility for the baby.

    "question": "What is Surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Surrogacy is a modern and growing means of bringing new life into the world, where a woman carries a baby for another person or a couple. The intended parents undergo IVF meaning fertilization outside of the body, to transfer their embryo into the surrogate’s uterus. In our work at ConceiveAbilities, surrogates are not genetically or legally related to the baby and are compensated for their time and service by the intended parents. In 2019, more than 17,000 births took place by surrogate in the United States and the market is steadily growing at 15% per year based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And, in the past ten years, the percentage of all IVF transfers that took place with a gestational carrier grew more than 5-fold, from just over 1% to 5.4%. A surrogate, or gestational carrier, is a woman who carries a baby for an individual or a couple that has no genetic relationship to her. The person who is trying to have a baby with the help of the surrogate is known as an intended parent. At ConceiveAbilities, we work with intended parents who undergo IVF so that the surrogate can carry a baby to whom she is not genetically or legally related. The surrogate is paid for her time and efforts by the intended parent(s). The embryo is created from the intended father’s sperm, or donor sperm, and the intended mother’s egg, or donor egg. When the baby is born, the intended parents are listed on the birth certificate as the legal parents and assume all responsibility for the child. Founder and CEO, Nazca Fontes, shared ConceiveAbilities expert knowledge of the surrogacy process with Healthline for their article What Is Gestational Surrogacy. People often misunderstand what a gestational carrier, or surrogate, is. Today, in a modern surrogacy journey, a gestational surrogate has no genetic relation to the baby she is carrying for another person. In prior times, however, a traditional surrogate used her egg and also carried the baby for the intended family. Dr. Daniel Shapiro of Reproductive Biology Associates further explains the difference between a traditional vs gestational surrogate. To understand surrogacy success rates is to understand how and why surrogacy is the best chance in making a dream of a family come true. This data helps potential surrogate mothers have confidence that their time and commitment to helping a family is highly likely to have a joyous outcome.

    "question": "Why Does Someone Need a Surrogate?",
    "answer": "There are many reasons people choose surrogacy to make their dream of a family come true including infertility, medical reasons, and men who don’t have a uterus. Some women have medical reasons like our intended mother Kelly Cesare who had a heart transplant and survived cancer. She shared her story in the New York Post article Surrogacy Legal in NY: What This Means For New Yorkers. Intended parent Ashley Katzen shared her fertility journey and how she decided to use a surrogate to build her family in An Intended Parent’s Surrogacy Journey. And ConceiveAbilities Intended Families, Crystal Patel & Kunal Mody and Randy Rowe & Kyle Keigan shared their surrogacy journey with VeryWell Family. Between 10-20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. According to the March of Dimes, that number may be as high as 50% when we take into account pregnancies ending before a woman misses a menstrual cycle. Intended parent, Lara Beth Levy, shared how she and her husband chose to use a surrogate after suffering miscarriages with the NY Post. Not all surrogacy journeys begin with an infertility diagnosis. Some choose surrogacy for personal reasons. Surrogacy is also a highly successful option for the LGBTQ+ community and single men to become parents.

    "question": "What is Infertility?",
    "answer": "Infertility is defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner and is inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. In patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at six months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. Infertility affects 6.7 million women in the U.S., about 11% of the population’s reproductive-age population. It’s estimated that 1 in 8 couples (or 12% of married women) has trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy. Fertility declines as people age. A couple of ages 29-33 with a normal functioning reproductive system has only a 20-25% chance of conceiving in any month.

    "question": "What Are Infertility Treatments?",
    "answer": "Some women seek infertility treatment using medicines like Letrozole to induce ovulation and improve endometrial thickness. Since Letrozole only addresses ovulation, it doesn’t impact other potential root causes of infertility. 40% of female infertility is related to tubal factor infertility. In order to get an official diagnosis, doctors may perform an hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test, a procedure that can help diagnose tubal occlusion or obstruction, as well as uterine malformations, pelvic inflammatory disease, and Asherman’s syndrome. Once confirmed, women may have a clearer understanding of the next steps to take in order to build their family. Couples that are pursuing infertility treatments may live on an emotional roller coaster, as each pregnancy attempt is high stakes. They learn the difference between a viable and non-viable pregnancy and, while a couple who suffers from a non-viable pregnancy may well find future success, repeated setbacks may lead the couple to consider a different path to build their family.

    "question": "Why Does Someone Become a Surrogate?",
    "answer": "For many people, their path to parenthood has been challenging. Knowing that surrogacy gives them the best chance to hold their baby in their arms is remarkable. As more people turn to surrogacy, more women are finding themselves called to surrogacy. Why? ConceiveAbilities recently hired research firm Accelerant Research to better understand surrogates. The firm surveyed 100 surrogates, more than 500 qualified surrogacy prospects and more than 1,000 women from the general population. Of the surrogates and qualified surrogacy prospects, Accelerant found: More than half volunteer regularly\nNearly half are registered blood and organ donors\nAlmost one-quarter of them foster pets\nMore than three-quarters said they did so because they knew someone personally in need\nTwo-thirds said they had first-hand exposure to a relative or close friend’s struggle with weighing the infertility “We found that the single biggest motivation for surrogates is the simple desire to help,” Nazca Fontes, CEO of ConceiveAbilities shared. “Eighty-seven percent said they find joy in helping others; 74 percent reported they are motivated by a sense of empowerment as a surrogate.” Other driving factors include that 78 percent of these women know someone in need and 68 percent want to support the LGBTQ community. Deciding to become a surrogate is a deeply personal and courageous decision. There is a lot of information about surrogacy to research. Listen to our podcast Busting Surrogacy Myths with OB-GYN Dr. Heather Carlson who explains the facts of surrogacy and dispels some surrogate misconceptions. One of the biggest surrogacy myths is that the surrogate is genetically related to the baby. ConceiveAbilities surrogates have no genetic relationship to the intended parent(s)’ child.",

Remember, each clinic and each IVF cycle can be different, but this is an example of what an IVF calendar may look like: Step 1: For the first three weeks, many women take birth control to regulate hormone levels and to synchronize her menstrual cycle so that the timing is aligned with the medical protocol. Step 2: The day the woman gets her period is an important step in the IVF process. She will continue to take birth control pills to maintain the regulation of hormones.

It was a lot to take in at once to be honest. My first thought was with Ashley, and the emotional duress that she had endured thus far in her life. In addition to the physical pain from the rehabilitation, the mental anguish that she had to experience at such a young age was terrible. I then realized that I needed to educate myself on surrogacy and what our path forward would be to have a family.

This helps prevent the conversion of androgen to estrogen, effectively suppressing estrogen production. Women who have been diagnosed with hormone-receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer often take the drug after surgery, chemotherapy or radiation to help reduce the risk of cancer returning. Because Letrozole specifically reduces estradiol levels in the body, it caught the attention of reproductive endocrinologists.",

  },
  {
    "question": "When do options such as surrogacy and egg donation come into the fertility picture?",
    "answer": "Since Letrozole only addresses ovulation, it doesn’t impact other potential root causes of infertility. The odds of achieving a pregnancy are best when both the egg and sperm come from young, healthy sources that have met specific medical criteria. This may mean using an egg donor. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, IVF with a donor egg has a success rate of 52%, which is the highest of any fertility treatment. Higher still is the rate of success with a surrogate. IVF clinics in the US have a surrogacy success rate of about 75%, and that number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. It’s important to understand your options when it comes to infertility treatment. If you’ve considered surrogacy or an egg donor to build your family, contact ConceiveAbilities. Our team is excited to share more information, success stories and support as you make your decision. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy?

    "answer": "When my husband and I started the surrogacy process, we were not really sure what expectations we should have as it was very new to us. All we knew for certain was that we wanted to find a surrogate who was totally open, honest and willing to be flexible and understanding. We also both felt it was very important for our surrogate to come from a nurturing home with a supportive and loving family. When we started working with ConceiveAbilities, we were told that matching with someone is like dating and when you know you know. That is exactly how it happened when we matched with our surrogate! The moment we hung up the phone, we knew what our expectations were and that she was everything we had hoped for. We learned that this whole experience is not only about our needs because it is our baby, but it is also about the gestational carrier’s needs which are just as important.",

    "question": "What is Surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Many of you may be asking what is surrogacy and how did that help Nick and Priyanka grow their family. Surrogacy is a modern and growing means of bringing new life into the world, where a woman carries a baby for another person or a couple. The intended parents undergo IVF meaning fertilization outside of the body, to transfer their embryo into the surrogate’s uterus. A surrogate, or gestational carrier, is a woman who carries a baby for an individual or a couple that has no genetic relationship to her. Our job as a surrogacy agency is to help find and match a surrogate and intended family who have shared values and expectations. More and more families like Nick and Priyanka are turning to surrogacy as a successful option to help build their family. Many celebrities from Kim Kardashian to Neil Patrick Harris have chosen to partner with a surrogate to make their family dreams come true. And it’s not just celebrities. In 2019, surrogates were part of 5.4% of all in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. Why? It is the most successful treatment for infertility, with a 75% success rate. That number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. Watch fertility expert Dr. Robby Setton of Shady Grove Fertility in New York talk about how surrogacy has been normalized.",

We took a pause on surrogacy, though, due to deciding to have another child of our own. We picked things back up a few years later when both our children were a little bit older.

Giving shots was a small hurdle but nothing big. Laci was better about it than I was. I think a second part of this question is that I was initially hesitant in telling our families what we were doing, because going through pregnancy for another couple rather than bringing another child to the family seemed controversial. Most of the family was very supportive in this journey and, those that had questions about it, mainly did not know what it was. Once we informed them the child would not have our genetic material, they were relieved and became accepting of the idea.”",

They had a lot of experience with many couples and surrogate journeys. They always encouraged us to do what was best and right in our minds when it came to the whole process. One thing that helped me early on was remembering Laci had a yearning to help another family to become as complete as we are in our own lives. Knowing that she had a desire to help others was always the root of why she decided to be a surrogate, and I did not want to stop her pursuit.”",

    "question": "Can you describe your infertility struggle? When did you first find out you would be unable to carry?",
    "answer": "At 16 years old I was diagnosed with vaginal agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. My mother was concerned that I had not gotten my period, so we went to the OB for a checkup. To everyone’s surprise, our doctor noticed that there was an absence of my vaginal canal. We then proceeded with an ultrasound and learned that I did have my eggs, but that my uterus and cervix were missing, as well. During that time, I had to make a very difficult decision with my mother on whether or not I was going to surgically create a vaginal canal, or choose dilator treatment, which is done independently. I followed my doctor’s recommendation and spent over a year independently using dilators. The main disadvantage is that it required using a dilator 3 times a day (different sizes as I progressed through my journey) for 20 minutes at a time (on a bicycle seat) until eventually, the vaginal canal was stretched to a normal length. I really did not know pain and discomfort until that experience. I also did not understand the magnitude of how difficult it would be – both emotionally and physically – when it came time to have kids. I do, however, remember thinking that nothing would have been worse than that experience. As I got older and had boyfriends, I had to explain my situation with not being able to get pregnant, and many of them were not too accepting. News also started to get around about my situation in high school, and people doubted my gender and whether or not I was born a female. The struggle was unimaginable at such a young age, but it truly prepared me for IVF and my surrogacy journey.",

And that’s only one of several motivators for our surrogates, who work from a common foundation of confidently empowering others to build a family who otherwise could not. That said, the surrogacy calling is not for everyone. Those that are accepted as surrogates at ConceiveAbilities succeed through a careful approval process. The intended parents you meet are just as carefully screened. With a 97% success rate after the first meeting, you can be confident that we know how to make matches that make sense.",

    "answer": "We want to share some information that may prove helpful. While it is not meant to provide medical guidance or drive healthcare decisions, we hope to help you better understand why the ability to continue your journey to build a family has potentially become delayed. The spread of COVID-19 is still not completely understood.\nWe expect to continue to see an increase in cases as more testing comes online. In a way, this is a good thing as it’s allowing the exposure that already exists to become known, quantified and better managed by the state and local health professionals.\nThe risk to any one of us, as an individual, even those that are older or have compromised immunity or travel on an airplane, is low.\nHowever, the exact opposite is true for local populations: because of the rapid increase in cases which can exceed the capacity of any given community’s health system to treat not just COVID-19, but many other illnesses.\nThe primary public health strategy to lower this risk is to attempt to “flatten the curve” of how quickly this virus spreads. By doing so, the risk to any local population is reduced, for two reasons. One, there is greater capacity for health systems in that locale to attend to those individuals with this disease. Two, it buys time for the possibility of other treatments to come available and for the spread of the disease to wane.\nHopefully you now have a better understanding for why we are all seeing such aggressive “protective measures” to continue to cancel, delay, and limit large gatherings of people.",

    "question": "How does endometriosis affect implantation?",
    "answer": "When you’re trying to conceive, the embryo that’s created needs to implant itself into the uterine lining to achieve a successful pregnancy. As you learn and understand more about endometriosis and how the uterine lining may or may not be compromised, you may be concerned about whether an embryo (whether it’s created through natural conception or IVF) may be unable to implant. In a study done by Yale University on this exact concern, it did show in some cases there might be a lower implantation rate. However, reproductive technology is constantly evolving and recently, a new test emerged that looks at endometrial receptivity that can offer the optimal time to transfer an embryo.",

    "question": "Does endometriosis affect IVF success rates?",
    "answer": "There are a lot of factors when it comes to answering this question. It depends on the severity of the endometriosis, how it was treated previously (meaning, if surgical measures such as laparoscopy was used prior to the IVF cycle) and how much time has lapsed in between surgery and the IVF cycle. A study was done about this exact topic by The Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology and overall, the biggest factor appears to be how intense the endometriosis is. This is another reason why early diagnosis and intervention, if at all possible, can be incredibly helpful.",

    "answer": "Typically, depending on how severe the endometriosis is suspected to be, the first lines of defense are over the counter pain medications like Advil, Motrin, Naproxen or Aleve. Hormone treatments are an option as well such as birth control pills. In general, these treatments aren’t always sufficient for endometriosis since diagnosis tends to require surgical confirmation. Surgical options range from the earlier mentioned laparoscopy to a slightly more invasive procedure called a laparotomy. Typically, a skilled surgeon can diagnose and treat endometriosis with minimally invasive techniques.",

    "question": "How does smoking impact my eggs?",
    "answer": "Smoking and tobacco products damage the genetic material in eggs. There are also many chemicals in tobacco products that can speed up how quickly eggs are lost. Nicotine and carbon monoxide, for example, impact how quickly eggs die off, and they cannot be replaced once they are lost. In addition to speeding up egg loss, smoking can impact your egg quality and the ovarian function necessary to be a successful donor. Ovarian stimulation, or follicular recruitment, is used to help donors produce multiple eggs through hormone administration. Smoking can have a detrimental impact on how you respond to this important part of the donor process. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, female smokers need more ovary-stimulating medications during IVF and still have fewer eggs at retrieval, and infertility rates are about twice as high with smokers compared to nonsmokers. Smoking and smokeless tobacco products can both have the same effect on egg quality and overall fertility, so it is important to steer clear of anything that falls into this category during all stages of the egg donor process.",

    "question": "Can I smoke marijuana if it is legal in my state?",
    "answer": "No. There is not as much scientific evidence of exact clinical impacts of marijuana on fertility, but there are other risks associated with using marijuana if you are considering becoming an egg donor. Studies have shown that marijuana use can interfere with ovulation and other reproductive functions. The active ingredient in marijuana, THC, interferes with the brain’s endocannabinoid system, which can change how the brain and reproductive organs communicate. In other words, it can throw your reproductive functions off balance. It is widely agreed in the medical community that more research is needed to determine the exact impacts of marijuana on fertility, eggs, and overall health. Since there is research already indicating that marijuana use impacts ovulation cycles, abstaining from marijuana is an important qualification to become a donor. If you are using marijuana for medical reasons and are still considering egg donation, speak with your doctor and team at ConceiveAbilities to discuss your unique circumstances.",

    "question": "Can I become a donor if I quit smoking?",
    "answer": "It depends. Fertility starts to improve as soon as you quit smoking. Donation agencies vary, but many will allow you to apply to become a donor after three months of not smoking or using tobacco products. Depending on how long and how heavily you smoked, you may need to wait longer for your egg quality to improve enough to donate, or you may not be eligible to be a donor. While quitting smoking can improve your fertility over time, the loss of egg supply is irreversible. The short and long term impacts of smoking vary among women, so you might have regular nicotine testing as part of your process to become a donor. It is also important to be up front with your team at ConceiveAbilities from the beginning about your history with smoking to ensure a safe and secure situation for everyone. Remember, the intended parents are counting on your honesty and commitment to this crucial aspect of the process. There may be other long-term effects of smoking that can impact your qualifications to become a donor, such as your overall physical and emotional health. It’s no secret that smoking has many side effects outside of fertility, including higher risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Your doctor can help you determine if any other smoking related health concerns should be considered as you think about becoming an egg donor.",

    "question": "Can I have a baby after being a surrogate?##",
    "answer": "Yes. Many of our surrogates go on to complete a sibling journey (a second pregnancy with the same family), become a repeat surrogate for a different family, or become pregnant with their own baby. Surrogacy and traditional pregnancy are different in many ways – the support you get through your agency and the fact that the baby you’re carrying is not biologically yours are the most obvious. But despite these differences, they physical impact is the same. Your ability to carry a baby doesn’t change simply because you were a surrogate. It’s still important, however, to think about your long-term family building plans. Speaking with your doctor can be a good first step. If you are reaching an age where it might become harder to conceive, for example, your doctor can discuss if having a baby after surrogacy will be a safe option for you. They can also help you to identify any potential risks throughout your surrogacy in the event you do try to conceive again. It’s also important to make sure you and your partner, if you have one, are aligned. Surrogacy is a yearlong commitment, at minimum, so being on the same page about your timeline and plans to grow your family is imperative. Every surrogate’s path is unique, and your doctor is your best resource to answer questions about your individual circumstances and how they relate to future pregnancies.",

    "question": "Are there medical or other risks associated with surrogacy?",
    "answer": "A surrogate pregnancy carries essentially the same risks associated with carrying and giving birth to your own child. These risks can include everything from morning sickness and back pain to potentially more serious concerns like hypertension and gestational diabetes. The medical risks specific to surrogacy are generally minor. For example, you may experience bruising or a minor allergic reaction to IVF medications, or slight bleeding or cramping after the embryo transfer. These side effects are common, but it’s still important to keep your doctor and agency up to speed on these and any other reactions your body has throughout your surrogacy so they can best support you. One of the most common questions around surrogacy is if the surrogate mother develops an attachment to the baby. Will she find it hard to give the baby back to the intended parents? The reality is that most surrogates don’t give it a second thought. Our screening process ensures that surrogates are motivated by a genuine desire to help their intended parents. Surrogates echo that their intention in the journey makes it easy to avoid these concerns about attachment. Of course, your match manager and in house licensed mental health team are here to help you navigate emotions that may arise during or after your pregnancy. It can help to consider how this might impact your long-term family building plans.",

    "question": "Do I need to tell my match manager if I plan to become pregnant again?##",

You may not know going into your surrogacy whether or not you plan to have another baby afterwards, and that’s just fine. But if you know that another pregnancy is something you are striving for, it’s helpful to keep your team at ConceiveAbilities in the loop for several reasons. First, we are here to support you in every way we can throughout every step of your journey. Being aware of your goal to have another baby gives us a better opportunity to provide specific support you may need during your surrogacy. Additionally, this is important to factor in the matching process. We take pride in creating successful matches (with a 97% first time match rate!) because of the many factors considered. One consideration might be a sibling journey to follow the first surrogacy. This match wouldn’t be the best fit if you are hoping to get pregnant with your own baby shortly after.

    "answer": "Our repeat surrogates often speak directly to the overwhelming support of their families when it comes to their decision to do a repeat journey. That’s mirrored when we talk to their partners and families. They frequently tell us how proud they are of the strong women they support through multiple journeys. That said, every family has a different set of circumstances to consider, and it is your responsibility to have an open and honest conversation with your family about your decision. Having a strong support system, including your family and your tribe, is a crucial part of a successful surrogacy. Reflecting on and discussing how your lifestyle may have changed since your most recent surrogacy can be a good starting point, including things like how your own child(ren) have changed, lifestyle shifts like a new career or caring for a loved one, and changes to your health. Each of these are things you may want to talk about with your family as you determine the best path for you. One thing we can say for certain is that you will have a deeply rooted support system with your team at ConceiveAbilities and your surrogate sisters. Our team is here to support you every step of the way from your application to the birth of your surro-baby. You’ll also have the support, experiences, advice, and everything else that comes with an amazing group of women who have their own diverse experiences with surrogacy.

Their past journeys help them know what to expect, and their experience gives them the unique ability to help their intended parents feel even more secure in the process. We’re also grateful that our repeat surrogates love working with us! Surrogates who have worked with other agencies before often tell us how much they appreciate our level of support and community-building. They appreciate the security and confidence we provide with things like a dedicated Match Manager, licensed mental health professionals, a legal team well-versed in fertility law, and a tribe in the Surrogate Sisterhood to share the journey with. Your success is our success, and our experience and proven track record provides our surrogates peace of mind in knowing they are supported through every step of their journey. Whether you’re considering a second or a fourth surrogacy journey, you are among an elite group of women who are considering a repeat surrogacy. Our surrogates have genuinely positive experiences throughout their journeys, regardless of their reason.

You’ll need to have given birth to and be raising at least one of your own children, have a stellar medical history, demonstrate financial and overall stability, and pass a comprehensive mental health evaluation. You’ll undergo a home check too, just like your fellow prospective surrogates who are married. One requirement that takes on quite a bit more significance when you’re single, though, is your social support network. This is because partners are typically the primary providers of emotional and physical support to surrogates during pregnancy and after delivery. And it’s a fact that whether for a surrogacy or not, pregnancy can be both challenging and unpredictable. As a result, you’ll definitely want to have a support system in place, and ensure that you’ve considered all of the following: Do you have people in your life who support your decision to become a surrogate? Can you lean on them emotionally when needed, and can you also share your surrogacy hopes and successes with them?\nWho will care for your children when you need to travel, attend appointments, and participate in monthly support groups?\nWho will help you with any household and childcare needs during periods of bed rest? If you experience severe morning sickness? As you recover from childbirth? When your pregnancy becomes either exhausting or physically taxing? When you just simply need a break?\nCan you call upon specific friends or family members in an emergency, and can they reach you quickly?",

    "question": "What are some of the biggest challenges of being a single mom during a surrogacy journey, and how can I meet them head-on?",
    "answer": "Everyone knows that being a single mom is probably already one of the hardest jobs around, right? On top of that, chances are good that you probably have work and/or school commitments, too. Add on a surrogate pregnancy and the appointments, emails, phone calls, emotions, physical symptoms, and new relationships that go with it, and it’s clear that you’ll need to become even more of an expert juggler than you already are! You will absolutely be very busy, and you may occasionally feel more stressed and less supported than you did before becoming a surrogate, since you don’t have a live-in partner to confide in and to lean on. This, of course, is where growing your support system comes into play. It will be critically important to get comfortable with asking for and accepting help from your loved ones. As they shoulder some responsibilities for you temporarily, you can focus elsewhere, even if it means scheduling some needed and well-deserved time for self-care and rest. Physical and emotional recovery after a surrogacy delivery can also be more challenging for single moms – especially if delivery brings unexpected surprises, like a medical complication or a first-time emergency C-section. Again, this seems to be related to having less adult support available at home. The best way to meet this particular challenge head-on is to prepare for a range of possibilities in advance. Have plenty of back-up support ready and “on call,” just in case you end up needing it. Then, if you do need extra support after delivery, definitely ask for it!",

ConceiveAbilities surrogates are also part of monthly support groups and an online sisterhood. These resources allow you to connect with hundreds of current and former surrogates throughout the country and in your local area. This is a great way to get to know other women who can truly relate to your more unique circumstances and challenges. You’ll find yourself receiving support from many other surrogates, regardless of whether they too are single moms.

    "answer": "This is an important question! Even if you suspect right now that you absolutely won’t want to date during a surrogacy journey, what if that special someone happens to enter your life at that exact time? Not dating during your surrogacy does make things simpler; however, dating is not completely prohibited. It’s just very important to make good choices when choosing dating partners. After all, remember that you either are or will be carrying some precious cargo! Your intended parents didn’t enter into a surrogacy arrangement agreeing to work with your new romantic partner, so you’ll want to feel sure that it’s a person who both you and they can trust and respect. And of course this person should be completely on-board with and supportive of your surrogacy. If a romantic relationship seems to be taking a more serious turn, and it’s clear that both of you want to be exclusive and perhaps have sex, always prioritize the surrogacy and inform your match manager first. It’s taken a lot of effort to become a surrogate, and you won’t want to do anything to jeopardize an upcoming embryo transfer, put yourself in an unsafe situation during the pregnancy, or lose the trust of your intended parents. Let your match manager know what’s going on in the relationship and where it seems to be heading. He or she will then guide you toward the next steps. Depending on the particular stage of the surrogacy process that you’re in at the time, your new significant other may need to participate in the legal process with you, or he/she may need to undergo psychological and/or medical testing just as married partners are required to do.

The upper limits of these requirements are typically quite high, since a.) older parents can still be very good parents, and b.) personal circumstances lead many individuals to pursue surrogacy later in life, rather than during the earlier and more traditional childbearing years.

Asian donors typically receive upwards of $10,000 per cycle. Donor compensation will be discussed in much greater detail during your initial consultation with our team, so you will have a clearer idea of what you can expect your egg donor pay to be.",

    "question": "What are the requirements to become an egg donor?",
    "answer": "There are a number of requirements to become an egg donor, ranging from medical to physical to mental health aspects. In order to be considered a suitable donor candidate, you must meet the following criteria. You are of prime childbearing age. As it specifically relates to egg donation, you must be between the ages of 21-28 years old. If a candidate is outside of this range, she is more likely to have poor quality, or aneuploidy, eggs. This means the eggs have an abnormal number of cells and cannot develop into viable embryos. You don’t smoke. This includes nicotine, vaping, and general drug use. You are physically healthy. This includes a BMI under 28, regular monthly menstrual cycles, and no reproductive disorders or abnormalities. Your birth control method matters. Donor candidates cannot currently be on the Depo-Provera shot or have an Implanon/Nexplanon arm implant. Not only can these hormones impact your cycle, they can impact the way your body responds to fertility medication.",

    "question": "What is “social surrogacy”?",
    "answer": "Historically, the inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to term have been the primary circumstances for intended parents choosing surrogacy. Considering our modern culture, this scope is limited. ConceiveAbilities’ mission is to help women and couples with fertility issues, global couples navigating geopolitical issues, and same-sex couples or singles who are unable to – or choose not to – carry a baby. There are many reasons that a woman may not want to carry a child, and there is an increasing number of women who are able to conceive that choose surrogacy – sometimes referred to as “social surrogacy.” Whatever your reason for deciding on surrogacy, you will be supported through every step of the way with leading experts and a compassionate and customized approach to your journey.",

    "question": "Are there requirements for intended parents to use surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Personal RequirementsThere is no extensive list of requirements for an intended parent to use a surrogate, but it’s important to consider the implications of the financial and emotional investment you are making in your family. Surrogacy is a marathon, not a sprint, and willingness to navigate the road ahead is a vital prerequisite. ConceiveAbilities screens their applicants, but not through a list of checkboxes. We conduct a background check and most of our clients meet with a psychologist through their fertility clinic to discuss the emotional dynamics of surrogacy. The surrogacy process begins with a consultation. We have designed our process to help you through every step of the way, and what that looks like will be different for every intended parent. Your initial consultation will help us learn more about your unique goals and motivations, and will give you all the information you need to know about the steps of surrogacy. We also believe that Matching Matters and have developed a proprietary process to ensure we find the surrogate that is a perfect match for you. Here, we learn everything from your communication style to your expectations after the baby is born to make sure we connect you to a surrogate with whom you’ll be most compatible. Legal RequirementsSurrogacy is not legal everywhere, and the nuances of laws where surrogacy is legal can vary by state. Typically, the state laws where the baby is born determine which laws apply to parentage. You will have the expertise of a team to ensure that your needs and goals align with the specific legalities of your surrogate’s location. Medical RequirementsConceiveAbilities is a gestational surrogacy agency, meaning that the surrogate is not genetically related to the baby she carries. The embryo is created using the intended parents’ sperm and egg or donor sperm and/or egg. The health of the gestational carrier and the baby are top priority in a surrogacy arrangement, so all donors undergo medical screening when the embryos are created to ensure that any genetic factors or family history are accounted for. Since the intended parents may or may not be the donors in gestational surrogacy, the requirement of medical records for intended parents can vary by state, agency, or unique circumstances within each surrogacy arrangement.",

    "question": "What is a mock cycle?",
    "answer": "First, let’s define this process. Simply put, a mock cycle is a trial run of medications for your surrogate, typically occurring prior to her medical clearance. This is different from the medication cycle that precedes an embryo transfer, because it does not lead to an embryo transfer at the end. Instead, it’s a preparatory step that is ordered for your surrogate by the fertility doctor to help gauge your surrogates response. Mock cycles can and do look different and last for varying lengths of time (anywhere from a few weeks to one month), depending on the doctor who is ordering them. In every case, though, surrogates will take some or all of the same hormonal medications that they will also take during the actual embryo transfer cycle. Bodily responses to the mock cycle medications are monitored throughout the cycle as well. Ultrasounds measure how the medications are impacting the uterine lining, while lab work measures the surrogate’s hormone levels. Once the medications have achieved the desired results, the mock cycle ends, and your surrogate is considered ready to move forward with an embryo transfer.",

  {
    "question": "Will my surrogate definitely need a mock cycle?",
    "answer": "Not necessarily. Many clinics evaluate the surrogate’s uterine lining during the medical work-up, at a specific point during her menstrual cycle. If her lining is appropriately thick at that time, your doctor may determine that a mock cycle is not necessary for her. Her body may already be showing signs of being able to achieve the changes that are needed to support a pregnancy, which is great news! If your surrogate does require a mock cycle, however, remember that it is simply a helpful tool for your doctor. Rest assured, most surrogates do “pass” the mock cycle and go onto the embryo transfer stage.",

    "question": "Are there additional costs for the mock cycle?",
    "answer": "Unless your fertility clinic requires a mock cycle for every surrogate and factors those expenses into your overall fees, definitely expect to pay extra for this process. Your surrogate will be completing medical appointments and also taking extra medications, so there will be additional charges. The total cost will vary depending on your clinic’s protocol for the mock cycle (types of medications ordered; length of the cycle; number of monitoring appointments; etc). Regardless, though, if the mock cycle ultimately leads to a successful embryo transfer cycle, you may still have saved money in the long run.",

    "question": "What Happens During and After a Miscarriage?",
    "answer": "Miscarriage during your surrogate pregnancy may become apparent after you experience symptoms like bleeding and cramping. (Keep in mind that these symptoms do not always indicate an impending miscarriage, though.) Or, you may attend a routine medical appointment, where you learn that the gestational sac is empty, or the baby has stopped growing and doesn’t have a heartbeat. If any of these scenarios do occur, it is very important that you immediately seek and accept care from your medical provider, who will also advise you on your next steps. Effective treatment options for miscarriage may include: Expectant managementThis option lets the miscarriage progress on its own, allowing the tissue from the pregnancy to leave your body naturally. The length of time this process takes can vary significantly, possibly lasting anywhere from two to four weeks. As you might imagine, needing to wait for the inevitable to happen, or needing to endure unpleasant symptoms over this period of time, can be emotionally challenging. Medical treatmentIf you prefer to complete the miscarriage naturally but more quickly, your medical provider may prescribe medication to speed the process along. This medication, taken either orally or vaginally, causes your body to expel the pregnancy tissue, often within 24 hours. Some surrogates do report increased cramping with this method. Surgical treatmentA final option is to schedule a D&C (dilation and curettage), which is a minor surgical procedure often performed under general anesthesia in a hospital setting. This procedure involves dilation of the cervix and removal of the tissue inside the uterus. Luckily, complications from this procedure are uncommon; although there is typically mild cramping and light bleeding afterward, most women do resume their normal activities as soon as a day or two after the surgery. This treatment option does also offer the greatest possibility of being able to test the fetal tissue afterward, in the event a genetic abnormality that contributed to the pregnancy loss can be identified.",

    "question": "What is Surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Surrogacy is a modern and growing means of bringing new life into the world, where a woman carries a baby for another person or a couple. The intended parents undergo IVF meaning fertilization outside of the body, to transfer their embryo into the surrogate’s uterus. In our work at ConceiveAbilities, surrogates are not genetically or legally related to the baby and are compensated for their time and service by the intended parents. In 2019, more than 17,000 births took place by surrogate in the United States and the market is steadily growing at 15% per year based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And, in the past ten years, the percentage of all IVF transfers that took place with a gestational carrier grew more than 5-fold, from just over 1% to 5.4%. A surrogate, or gestational carrier, is a woman who carries a baby for an individual or a couple that has no genetic relationship to her. The person who is trying to have a baby with the help of the surrogate is known as an intended parent. At ConceiveAbilities, we work with intended parents who undergo IVF so that the surrogate can carry a baby to whom she is not genetically or legally related. The surrogate is paid for her time and efforts by the intended parent(s). The embryo is created from the intended father’s sperm, or donor sperm, and the intended mother’s egg, or donor egg. When the baby is born, the intended parents are listed on the birth certificate as the legal parents and assume all responsibility for the child. Founder and CEO, Nazca Fontes, shared ConceiveAbilities expert knowledge of the surrogacy process with Healthline for their article What Is Gestational Surrogacy. People often misunderstand what a gestational carrier, or surrogate, is. Today, in a modern surrogacy journey, a gestational surrogate has no genetic relation to the baby she is carrying for another person. In prior times, however, a traditional surrogate used her egg and also carried the baby for the intended family. Dr. Daniel Shapiro of Reproductive Biology Associates further explains the difference between a traditional vs gestational surrogate. To understand surrogacy success rates is to understand how and why surrogacy is the best chance in making a dream of a family come true. This data helps potential surrogate mothers have confidence that their time and commitment to helping a family is highly likely to have a joyous outcome.

    "question": "Why Does Someone Need a Surrogate?",
    "answer": "There are many reasons people choose surrogacy to make their dream of a family come true including infertility, medical reasons, and men who don’t have a uterus. Some women have medical reasons like our intended mother Kelly Cesare who had a heart transplant and survived cancer. She shared her story in the New York Post article Surrogacy Legal in NY: What This Means For New Yorkers. Intended parent Ashley Katzen shared her fertility journey and how she decided to use a surrogate to build her family in An Intended Parent’s Surrogacy Journey. And ConceiveAbilities Intended Families, Crystal Patel & Kunal Mody and Randy Rowe & Kyle Keigan shared their surrogacy journey with VeryWell Family. Between 10-20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. According to the March of Dimes, that number may be as high as 50% when we take into account pregnancies ending before a woman misses a menstrual cycle. Intended parent, Lara Beth Levy, shared how she and her husband chose to use a surrogate after suffering miscarriages with the NY Post. Not all surrogacy journeys begin with an infertility diagnosis. Some choose surrogacy for personal reasons. Surrogacy is also a highly successful option for the LGBTQ+ community and single men to become parents.

    "question": "What is Infertility?",
    "answer": "Infertility is defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner and is inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. In patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at six months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. Infertility affects 6.7 million women in the U.S., about 11% of the population’s reproductive-age population. It’s estimated that 1 in 8 couples (or 12% of married women) has trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy. Fertility declines as people age. A couple of ages 29-33 with a normal functioning reproductive system has only a 20-25% chance of conceiving in any month. After six months of trying, 60% of couples will conceive without medical assistance. Approximately one-third of infertility is attributed to the female partner, one-third to the male partner, and one-third is caused by a combination of problems in both partners or is unexplained.",

    "question": "What Are Infertility Treatments?",
    "answer": "Some women seek infertility treatment using medicines like Letrozole to induce ovulation and improve endometrial thickness. Since Letrozole only addresses ovulation, it doesn’t impact other potential root causes of infertility. 40% of female infertility is related to tubal factor infertility. In order to get an official diagnosis, doctors may perform an hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test, a procedure that can help diagnose tubal occlusion or obstruction, as well as uterine malformations, pelvic inflammatory disease, and Asherman’s syndrome. Once confirmed, women may have a clearer understanding of the next steps to take in order to build their family. Couples that are pursuing infertility treatments may live on an emotional roller coaster, as each pregnancy attempt is high stakes.

As more people turn to surrogacy, more women are finding themselves called to surrogacy. Why? ConceiveAbilities recently hired research firm Accelerant Research to better understand surrogates. The firm surveyed 100 surrogates, more than 500 qualified surrogacy prospects and more than 1,000 women from the general population. Of the surrogates and qualified surrogacy prospects, Accelerant found: More than half volunteer regularly\nNearly half are registered blood and organ donors\nAlmost one-quarter of them foster pets\nMore than three-quarters said they did so because they knew someone personally in need\nTwo-thirds said they had first-hand exposure to a relative or close friend’s struggle with weighing the infertility “We found that the single biggest motivation for surrogates is the simple desire to help,” Nazca Fontes, CEO of ConceiveAbilities shared. “Eighty-seven percent said they find joy in helping others; 74 percent reported they are motivated by a sense of empowerment as a surrogate.” Other driving factors include that 78 percent of these women know someone in need and 68 percent want to support the LGBTQ community. Deciding to become a surrogate is a deeply personal and courageous decision. There is a lot of information about surrogacy to research. Listen to our podcast Busting Surrogacy Myths with OB-GYN Dr. Heather Carlson who explains the facts of surrogacy and dispels some surrogate misconceptions.

Some women choose to go this route because it is the most accessible option where they live; in Australia and Canada, for example, only altruistic surrogacy is permitted. Others choose it for the sake of familiarity with the intended parents. It’s important to remember, however, that there is a greater risk of strain on the relationship. Surrogacy is full of ups and downs, and while these can all be managed, it is immensely helpful to have the guidance of an experienced agency.

    "question": "What to look for when pairing with Intended Parents?",
    "answer": "Once you’ve settled on an agency, you’ll have plenty of support as you determine your best intended parent match. As you’ll quickly learn, the right match is crucial to a successful surrogate experience. In fact, outside of immediate family, there are few relationships more important than that of a surrogate and intended parent. And regardless of what kind of relationship you plan to have with one another, it’s important to be on the same page. A few points to consider: Do you prefer to connect via email, phone or text? Some surrogates and intended parents remain in regular contact during the pregnancy, whether it’s through phone calls or photos and texts. Some prefer to keep a more professional relationship, and that’s fine too. The types of communication vary, and these are points to discuss prior to your match so that our team can find intended parents with similar preferences. Will the attended parents be attending appointments? If the intended parents are local, they may or may not want to attend appointments with your medical practitioner. If they can’t be there in person, do they want to Skype or FaceTime? Would they just like an update afterward? And if the intended parents live far away, will they attend the 20-week appointment and anatomy scan? What about a birth plan? It’s important to discuss these details in advance, which is something your designated match manager will help you navigate. What does future contact look like? While it can be tough to know exactly how your relationship with the intended parents will look after the baby is born, consider whether you would like to remain in contact with them. For some, a photo may be exchanged here and there, but the relationship was primarily for the duration of the pregnancy. Again, this is just fine and may even be your preference. The agency will discuss these possibilities with you prior to your match, and will likely encourage this conversation during your match meeting.",

Having a hormonal imbalance means your ovaries are not able to make the hormones needed for an egg to fully mature. That can prevent you from ovulating.

Depending on your particular situation, your doctor may recommend first trying an oral medication called Clomid and timed cycles, or they may suggest employing Assisted Reproductive Technology like intrauterine insemination [IUI] or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Most likely, there would be attempts taken first before the subject of surrogacy would be explored. In certain cases, since some experience insulin resistance and diabetic like complications due to their PCOS, they are more likely to experience gestational diabetes. They also have a higher chance of experiencing preeclampsia. Both mean that they might be at a higher risk of giving birth prematurely and/or needing a C-Section. While that will most likely not prevent you from carrying your own child, you should feel comfortable discussing this with your doctor. Only you and your physician can truly decide what’s the best, safest and healthiest plan to expand your family. If you do find yourself in need of a surrogate, please register to learn more.

    "question": "Can I Become a Surrogate If I am Separated?",
    "answer": "Reputable agencies have many requirements for acceptance into their surrogacy program. While a status of “married” is not required, we do want to be clear that ConceiveAbilities does not accept applicants who are legally, officially, or unofficially “separated.” If you are in the middle of an adjustment to your marital status or are very recently divorced, now is likely not the right time to begin a surrogacy journey. Our acceptance team typically requires applicants to have a settled status of “single” or officially “divorced” for a few months prior to beginning their journey. There may be other agencies who are not as particular about this requirement, but that should give you pause. ConceiveAbilities has been helping to build families for over twenty-five years. In that time, we have gained many valuable insights about what it takes to have a smooth journey. We know from our success that starting off from a settled position truly is worth the wait.

    "question": "What is BMI and why is it important?",
    "answer": "Simply put, BMI, or body mass index, is a measurement that represents a relationship between a person’s height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an individual’s body weight by their height. While it is, of course, not the only factor in assessing overall health, BMI provides a more accurate estimate of a person’s total body fat than the number on a scale. A higher BMI can be indicative of higher amount of body fat as a percentage of total weight, which is an important factor in assessing health risks that can lead to dangerous pregnancies such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Other health concerns that can be associated with a higher BMI include: Sleep apnea\nArthritis\nHypertension\nDiabetes and gestational diabetes\nMultiple forms of cancer In the same way that it is important to eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and have check-ins with your healthcare professional, it is important to know your BMI and understand the impact it can have on both long and short term health. While not a perfect indicator of potential health risks, BMI is a crucial part of the total picture of your comprehensive health. It is especially important to know if you are entering the surrogacy screening process. A BMI below 35, and ideally below 30, is a starting qualification and requirement to be a surrogate with ConceiveAbilities. Although BMI is not the only way to determine a health or pregnancy risk, there are multiple health risks to both the surrogate and the baby that have been linked to a BMI above these values. Hypertension and subsequent circulation loss to the baby, gestational diabetes, plus sleep apnea and its associated links to heart failure and intrauterine growth restriction are just a few examples of why ConceiveAbilities requires all surrogates to have a BMI below these values at the time that their surrogacy journey begins. It is simply not worth risking the health of the women we work with as surrogates, or risking a healthy pregnancy, to sidestep this requirement.",

    "question": "What is a normal BMI?",
    "answer": "According to the World Health Organization, a normal BMI falls between 18.5 and 25. A BMI between 25 to 30 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 is considered obese. A BMI lower than 18.5 is considered underweight. Before you make any drastic lifestyle changes, it’s important to remember that BMI is calculated using only height and weight measurements. It does not take factors such as muscle mass into account; certain people such as athletes may have a high BMI even without having a high body fat percentage since muscle weighs more than fat. If you believe you fall into this category of people and may be at risk of being denied for surrogacy, please start the process by completing this form and we will look forward to talking with you more about your individual circumstances. BMI may also not be representative of obesity-related health risks with children, whose growth goes hand-in-hand with varying amounts of body fat at different stages of physical development. Most of the general population doesn’t fall into these categories, though, and knowing your BMI can be a powerful and informative tool to assess your risk for obesity-related health concerns.",

    "question": "Is bonding possible while the surrogate mother is pregnant?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! In fact, pregnancy is a key time to start the bonding process regardless of whether a surrogate is involved. A major myth about surrogacy is that it will prevent you from connecting with your child. You can still bond with your baby during a surrogate pregnancy, it just takes a little creativity. Some parents set up an email account for their baby-to-be; not only can it be used by the child when they’re older, but it’s a special way to share thoughts and emotions that are sometimes most easily expressed through writing. You can include photos, videos, and even invite other family members to contribute. It can truly act as a family bonding experience – not to mention a built-in time capsule. Another great way to bond is through your baby’s sense of hearing. A fetus can hear sounds from inside the womb by about 24 weeks; consider utilizing Belly Buds, which allow parents to record messages for the surrogate to play back through tiny speakers. You can include favorite songs or even read a children’s book for baby; regular exposure to your voice will make it a familiar – and fast favorite – sound once he or she is born. Talk to your surrogate about how to best incorporate this into her daily routine. The birth itself, of course, can be a major bonding experience too. Intended parents are typically right there for the entire process and are recommended to have skin-to-skin contact with their baby immediately after birth. Work closely with your gestational carrier and surrogacy team to create a birth plan that meets everyone’s needs as closely as possible.",

    "answer": "On some level, you start preparation the moment you decide you want to have a baby. For some, bonding starts during pregnancy. This is not always the case, and that’s okay. Do the best you can to mentally prepare yourself for the impending change. There is a vulnerability that comes with being a new parent; you will find yourself in new situations with someone you’re just getting to know, and it can be challenging, frustrating and scary. The learning curve of parenthood is inevitable, but bonding with your child is an important part of that. And while the emotional preparation looks a bit different in a surrogate pregnancy, of course, that doesn’t change the ultimate bond you’ll have with your child.",

    "question": "How many IVF cycles should I have before giving up?",
    "answer": "Rather than “giving up,” try to reframe it as “going a different route.” Something important to consider is insurance. Currently, 15 states offer some degree of infertility insurance coverage. Under the Affordable Care Act, there are several different categories an insurance policy may fall under: No fertility insurance coverage\nInsurance Coverage for Infertility Diagnosis\nInsurance Coverage for Infertility Diagnosis and Limited Treatment\nFull Infertility Insurance Coverage\nMedication Coverage (which may or may not include fertility drugs) Thoroughly review the policy to determine your options. It’s also a good idea to meet with your clinic’s financial department to discuss in more detail. This can help you to decide how many cycles, if any, will have at least some coverage. Ultimately, the decision to continue is up to you and your reproductive endocrinologist. With or without insurance, only you can determine if you have the financial and emotional means to continue infertility treatment.",

  {
    "question": "What are your options after multiple failed IVF cycles?",
    "answer": "Considering insurance coverage at the outset makes your options much clearer in the event of a failed cycle. For example, you may have coverage for things like medication in a cycle with an egg donor or surrogate. Having this knowledge can ease some of the stress when discussing other options and may make the decision to continue a little less daunting. Egg donation is a top option to consider, especially if known chromosomal abnormalities have prevented a successful IVF cycle. If a woman is over 42 years old or has been diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, egg donation is often the recommended route. Using a donor egg still allows you to experience pregnancy and childbirth first-hand, as well as make decisions about the prenatal environment and lifestyle factors. Surrogacy is an excellent solution for women who are, for whatever reason, unable to carry a pregnancy. It’s also a highly successful option for unexplained infertility. IVF clinics in the US have a surrogacy success rate of about 75%. Once the gestational carrier is pregnant, the success rate for a healthy birth is as high as 95%.",

    "question": "What is Altruistic Surrogacy?",
    "answer": "According to our good friends at Merriam Webster, someone who is altruistic is defined as: “an unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others.” We can all agree here that it takes someone who is extremely unselfish to consider surrogacy, no matter if it is a commercial or altruistic agreement. In an altruistic surrogacy, a woman will carry a child as a great act of generosity, by waving financial compensation known as a “surrogacy fee” apart from the medical, legal, and other various pregnancy expenses that naturally occur in the process of surrogacy.",

    "category": "Compensation & Benefits"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the pros to altruistic surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Cost. It’s no hidden secret that surrogacy can be cost prohibitive especially for those couples and individuals who have already invested in years of fertility treatments prior to considering surrogacy. In a commercial surrogacy arrangement, the surrogate would receive compensation not only for the costs associated with carrying the pregnancy but also for her time and effort. While cost is an obvious pro, it is one of the biggest reasons why altruistic or low-comp surrogacy is considered and why some people overlook the risk factors that may be connected. Familiarity. Often, an “independent” or altruistic surrogate enters into a surrogacy because she personally knows the individual or couple, such as a close family member or friend, and is genuinely wanting to help them. Although entering into an altruistic surrogacy with someone you know, can also come with its own set of problems, it’s a beautiful gesture of kindness. It is also the basis for why most surrogates consider surrogacy – no matter if the agreement is compensated or not. Intended parents also may feel an increased level of comfort and trust since a relationship has already been previously established. Accessibility. Compensated surrogacy is illegal in some U.S. states and in several countries. For example, Australia and Canada only allow altruistic surrogacy arrangements. In these situations where the intended parent lives in a non-surrogacy friendly state or country, altruistic agreements may be the only option that intended parents have.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What are the cons to altruistic surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Relationships. In an altruistic agreement, you risk your relationship being strained over the course of the process and post birth. Surrogacy can be complicated and full of shared demands. While the intended parents endure the financial and emotional aspects, the surrogate is also going through a great deal physically and emotionally. Intended parents may withhold basic requests essential to the surrogacy since they are not compensating the surrogate, and in return, the surrogate may not feel comfortable asking her friend or family member for reimbursement of minor items and basic requests which will add up over time. You’ll have to ask yourself, can this relationship withstand a surrogacy, and is it worth the risk of the relationship. Less Safe-Guards. Using a reputable agency in a compensated surrogacy agreement will help navigate both the intended parents and the surrogate through the complex process. No stone is unturned, and there are protective measures that are put into place to protect both parties- such as background checks, psychological screening, and confirming financial stability. There is no third-party objective in an altruistic surrogacy agreement to help safe-guard potential risks. Cost. This can also be a con for several reasons. If this was the case for a commercial surrogacy agreement, intended parents and the gestational carrier would typically need to prove financial stability to enter into a surrogacy program with an agency. At the end of the day, the intended parent(s) need to be able to support the medical and various costs that accompany the surrogacy process, and the surrogate would need to prove that they are not doing it as a primary source of income. In the case of an altruistic agreement, the gestational carrier could incur more out of pocket costs, and the intended parents could also end up paying more due to misinformation or other various outliers.",

    "answer": "Undergoing a surrogacy is a great commitment. There are many first-time surrogates that may enter into an altruistic agreement, not fully aware what the emotional and physical role it will play in their day to day lives. The surrogate will need to attend a greater number of appointments, especially at the beginning stages of the process. There is also a significant impact on her family as they will be the ones who are supporting her on a daily basis. You’ll want your gestational carrier to feel appreciated for the level of sacrifice she is committing to. Compensation allows her to feel appreciated and recognized for her time and effort in helping you grow your family.",

    "question": "What are the legal aspects of an altruistic surrogacy?",
    "answer": "The legal process is relatively the same whether you consider to move forward with a commercial or altruistic surrogacy agreement. The intricate details must still be laid out in a gestational surrogacy agreement also known as a GSA, which is a legal contract that will bind the two parties throughout the surrogacy process. The difference is that in an altruistic GSA, there are no pre-negotiated financial details in regards to a surrogacy/base fee. While an altruistic surrogacy, like any surrogacy agreement, is a beautiful gesture of kindness, it does come with risk. Every situation is unique and where some altruistic surrogacy experiences may be picturesque, for others, the risk may far outweigh the positive aspects of it.

    "question": "What is Tubal Factor Infertility?",
    "answer": "In a typical “trying to conceive” cycle, the ovary releases an egg into the fallopian tube where it would wait to be fertilized with sperm. The fertilized egg, the embryo, would then travel to the uterus and attach itself to the uterine lining (also known as implantation). This would mean you are pregnant. Since tubal factor infertility is when a woman’s Fallopian tube(s) are compromised either through scarring, damage or blockage, it can block a clear pathway in two ways: For the sperm to reach the egg in order to fertilize it.\nIf the egg is able to be fertilized and an embryo is created, it may not be able to reach the uterus so that it can properly implant.",

However, if you’ve had any of the above, such as endometriosis or PID, you may have experienced painful cramps or lower abdominal pain. There are two tests recommended to diagnose blocked fallopian tubes and they are: Hysterosalpingogram (HSG): This is a form of an X-ray that uses a dye that is gently passed through the cervix and into the fallopian tubes to see if they are blocked. This test is just one piece of the puzzle. If the HSG shows that your tubes appear to be opening, there may still be blockage or scarring within the lining of the tube. Laparoscopy: This is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that gives your doctor a more direct view of the fallopian tubes. While the HSG provides an X-ray, the laparoscope can give your doctor additional insight into whether the tubes are blocked or if there are other issues such as scar tissue or adhesions.",

    "answer": "When trying to conceive, you have various treatment options and you should feel comfortable reviewing them with your doctor to decide which works best for you. For example, in vitro fertilization (IVF) is an ideal option. It’s the process of when eggs are retrieved from the woman, then mixed with sperm from her husband, partner or male donor in a laboratory and then any resulting embryo(s) are transferred to the woman’s uterus. This is considered an ideal option to tubal factor infertility because it completely bypasses the fallopian tubes. It’s important to note that age is a factor with IVF even in cases of tubal factor infertility. Speak to your doctor about the success rates for your age group and if he or she recommends this as an option.",

Travel: Ultimately, it starts with determining which surrogacy program you will consider. Although both domestic surrogacy and international surrogacy can have some lengthy travel attached to it, international surrogacy programs will require the most, being that you will need to take time to travel abroad to another country. More than likely, travel will be required a few times over the course of the pregnancy and birth. Even in a domestic surrogacy, many surrogacy arrangements are made across state lines which would also require travel and missed time from your work and day to day life.\nMedical: There are two parts to this. If the intended parent(s) will be undergoing fertility treatment to produce an embryo for a gestational surrogacy arrangement, then the In Vitro Fertilization, or IVF, process can be rather life consuming. Albeit temporary, it will still require a great investment of time. Another factor to consider is how much time you will have to contribute to the pregnancy process. This will obviously depend on many factors, as well as determining how involved in the pregnancy you will want to be. If you want to take on an active role in the pregnancy, then you’ll need to account for missed work to attend the number of prenatal care appointments that accompany standard pregnancy. If there are unforeseen complications then you can expect to spend more time away.",

    "question": "Are you ready for parenthood?",
    "answer": "This may seem like a ridiculous question to ask yourself, but it’s on our list for a reason. The gift of a child through surrogacy is one that is immeasurable. Just getting to this point, of even considering it, means that you and your partner have likely had long discussions on planning future family building. It is important that you and your partner are unequivocally on the same page of wanting to pursue parenthood. Once your surrogate/gestational carrier is pregnant, fully understanding that this is your baby and that you will need to be ready physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially for your baby when his or her due date arrives.",

    "question": "What is international surrogacy?",
    "answer": "The obvious difference is the logistics of geography. Simply put, the surrogacy arrangement involves a gestational carrier who lives overseas apart from the intended parents. In most international surrogacies, there may be an expectation for the intended parents to travel to the gestational carrier’s country. Increasingly, intended parents are coming from abroad to work with American gestational carriers. However, some American intended parents still choose international surrogacy over domestic surrogacy.",

  {
    "question": "Is there a difference in cost?",
    "answer": "One of the attractive reasons for American intended parents using surrogacy abroad is to be cost prohibitive. It’s no secret that surrogacy can be an expensive process no matter if you are pursuing domestic or international surrogacy. However, the saying “cheaper is not always better” stands true when it comes to the surrogacy process. Saving costs abroad also means that you will likely be paying a lesser surrogacy fee to your gestational carrier. In any compensation agreement, you always want to pay someone what they fully deserve. This is not a place to cut corners on, especially for someone that will be carrying your child for 9 months. The same mindset can be said in using an international surrogacy program outside of the U.S. for the reproductive treatment process that comes along with a gestational surrogacy. Outside of the U.S., medical requirements can be less strict, including medications that are involved. This could be a potential risk to your gestational carrier and baby. You’ll want to make sure, whether you choose domestic or international surrogacy, that the overseeing clinic has guidelines and policies in place for their surrogacy program.",

    "question": "Is there a benefit to using American gestational carriers and egg donors?",
    "answer": "In comparison, U.S. surrogacy is fairly regulated and less complicated than in other countries abroad. Gestational carriers and egg donors not only go through strict medical screening, but they also have to undergo psychological screening as well. Many U.S. fertility clinics will also require the gestational carrier’s partner to participate in some leveling degree of screening as well. Another benefit to using an American gestational carrier/egg donor is that they are compensated appropriately and engaged in the ultimate goal of a successful and healthy pregnancy and birth. It is a lot to consider and there are many reasons why someone may choose international surrogacy over domestic surrogacy.

    "question": "What is idiopathic infertility?",
    "answer": "When you’ve been trying to conceive for the recommended amount of time and have not been able to get pregnant, it’s recommended you see a fertility specialist for an initial consultation. For women, this would entail an ultrasound and blood work to look at hormones such as her Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), Estradiol and her Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH). If no clear cause for infertility is seen after a review of health history and these tests are done, it is idiopathic, meaning it remains unknown. It’s also important to mention that this can come up as a cause of secondary infertility. A report by the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS estimates that there are more than 3 million US women with one child that have a difficult time getting pregnant again.

While they may be able to give you some basic information or perform general gynecological procedures, most will refer you to a fertility expert if you meet any of the above criteria. What’s the difference between a gynecologist and a fertility expert?

If you live in one of the 15 states that currently offer some degree of infertility treatment coverage, insurance parameters may impact your decision. The criteria for which you’re seeing a fertility specialist can have an impact on what clinic you choose, too. Depending on your fertility history, or what tests and procedures you’ll require, you may find that a doctor at one clinic is better suited to meet your medical needs. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) keeps a federal database of fertility clinics, which can also be a useful resource. The 1992 Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act requires the CDC to publish an annual ART Success Rates Report. Stats are several years behind (for example, current data is from 2016); while the information is not in real time, it will give a picture of a clinic’s success rates.

However, RESOLVE estimates the average cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at more than $8,000. Medication can cost an additional $3,000-$5,000, and any specialized tests increase the cost from there.

  {
    "question": "What is a viable pregnancy?",
    "answer": "A non-viable pregnancy means there is no chance of a live born baby. Depending on the stage of pregnancy, viability means different things. Before 6 weeks, it can mean that Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) levels are increasing normally. hCG is a hormone produced by the placenta during its implantation process in the uterus.\nAfter 6 weeks, a normal fetal heart indicates a viable pregnancy. A fetal heart with no heartbeat at any point is called fetal demise.\nAfter 22-24 weeks, a viable pregnancy is when a baby has a chance to survive outside of the womb. However, some countries without adequate neonatal care consider a pregnancy to be non-viable at less than 26-28 weeks gestation.Before 22-24 weeks, a non-viable pregnancy is when a baby delivered has no chance of survival, even if there is still a heartbeat in the uterus. Pregnancy is especially delicate in the first trimester, making it difficult to diagnose as viable or non-viable. These guidelines were developed to help define the ultrasound diagnosis of a non-viable pregnancy: Crown to rump length of > 6 mm and no heartbeat\nMean sac diameter of > 24 mm and no embryo\nNo fetal heartbeat >=2 weeks after a scan showed a gestational sac without a yolk sac\nNo fetal heartbeat > 10 days after a scan showed a gestational sac with a yolk sac",

  {
    "question": "What are the symptoms of a non-viable pregnancy?",
    "answer": "On a technical level, the viability of a pregnancy can initially be measured by hCG levels. While a home pregnancy test can detect it in urine, the most accurate number comes from a blood test. The level of hCG should double every two or three days. Once it reaches 2,000 mIU/ml, embryonic development should be visible on an ultrasound. A chemical pregnancy becomes non-viable shortly after implantation. While hCG levels may initially be elevated, the pregnancy does not continue to develop and there are rarely any symptoms. Unless they’ve used assisted reproductive technology (ART), most women won’t even know they were pregnant. If a pregnancy becomes non-viable later in gestation, however, there may be a variety of physical symptoms: Mild to severe cramps\nPain in the back or abdomen\nWhite-pink mucus\nPassing tissue or clot-like material\nLoss of pregnancy symptoms such as nausea, though this can happen in a viable pregnancy too Some women don’t learn their pregnancy is non-viable until they visit their doctor or midwife. By the 6th week of pregnancy, an ultrasound can determine whether there is a yolk sac within the gestational sac. The ultrasound should also be able to pick up a fetal pole, between the head (crown) and the bottom of the buttocks (rump); the length of the fetal pole is called crown-rump length. Finally, a healthy fetal heartbeat is a key factor in a viable pregnancy. Once the fetal heartbeat is present and healthy, the risk of miscarriage drops significantly.",

You will be encouraged to wait between one to three menstrual cycles before trying for another pregnancy. After more than one miscarriage, however, it’s best to speak with your health practitioner.

    "question": "What is IUGR?",
    "answer": "Intrauterine growth restriction, sometimes referred to as fetal growth restriction or small for gestational age (SGA), is a condition in which an unborn baby is not growing at a normal rate in the womb – the result is that the fetus is smaller than it should be for the gestational age. There are two types of IUGR; primary, or symmetric, IUGR means that all of the baby’s organs are growing too small. Asymmetric, or secondary, IUGR means the head and brain develop normally but the abdomen is too small. Asymmetric is more common than symmetric IUGR. It is also characterized as a fetal weight less than the 10th percentile, meaning it weighs less than 90 percent of all other fetuses at the same gestational age. Simple measurements, using the distance from the fundus, or top of the uterus, to the pubic bone, give a fairly accurate estimate of a baby’s size and can indicate growth issues. An ultrasound may then be performed to get more accurate measurements. If IUGR is found early or is particularly severe, amniocentesis testing will likely be recommended to determine if there is any other associated chromosomal issue. Regardless, the delayed growth can result in a host of complications during the pregnancy, delivery, and after the child is born.",

    "question": "Does IUGR affect brain development?",
    "answer": "A 2015 study showed that infants with IUGR were at high risk for antenatal, perinatal and postnatal complications. Infants with moderate to severe IUGR “are at increased risk of stillbirth and likely to be born preterm… growth-restricted infants present a high-risk subgroup of infants with a complex and distinct set of microstructural brain abnormalities not observed in appropriately grown infants.” Indeed, while babies with IUGR do not automatically experience long term brain damage or development issues, it does increase the risk for cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is a congenital disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture that can vary widely in severity. It is often marked by exaggerated reflexes, floppy or rigid limbs, and involuntary motion. Research indicates that the lower a baby’s size or weight due to IUGR, that more likely it is to have a more severe form of cerebral palsy. It’s unknown whether the slow growth causes brain damage, or if the damage occurs and results in IUGR. What we do know is that the postnatal period is critical; a baby’s brain grows by one percent each day in the few weeks after birth.",

    "question": "Can IUGR be treated?",
    "answer": "Currently, there are no specific treatments for IUGR while the baby is in utero. The mother may be administered medications if she is dealing with any health issues, but it ultimately depends on the baby’s gestational age. If the baby is past 34 weeks, doctors may opt to deliver prematurely. If the condition is discovered before 34 weeks, they will likely monitor the situation closely until 34 weeks. At that point, they will decide if the baby has a better shot at getting stronger outside of the uterus rather than in. Multiples, which often deliver preterm anyway, may especially benefit if IUGR is preventing normal growth.

    "question": "When should you start getting prenatal care?",
    "answer": "If you know you’re pregnant, or suspect you might be, it’s important to contact your health care provider to schedule a visit. Consider the type of care you’d like to receive during your pregnancy; will you work with an OB/Gyn? A midwife? Research the options in your area that most align with your needs. Depending on your situation and health history, you may go in for a confirmation pregnancy test. Your doctor may also perform an ultrasound to give a more accurate due date. Pregnancy is discussed in terms of months and trimesters. The first trimester is months 0-3, or weeks 0-17. The second trimester is months 4-6, or weeks 18-30. The third trimester is months 7-9, or weeks 31-42. Pregnancy is often thought of as 40 weeks, but full term is now considered any time between 39 weeks, 0 days and 40 weeks, 6 days. That spans 1 week before the due date to 1 week after the due date. And, at ConceiveAbilities, we are strong proponents of the Fourth Trimester, the 12 weeks after delivery, which is a crucial time for a strong postpartum recovery. In many cases, your first prenatal appointment may not take place until 8 weeks gestation. Prenatal care truly starts, however, the moment you even consider getting pregnant. Preconception health is an understanding of how your body is functioning, medications you’re taking and lifestyle considerations that could have an impact on your pregnancy and the health of the unborn baby. The Office on Women’s Health recommends women give themselves three months to prepare before getting pregnant. The five things to prioritize include: Taking 400-800 micrograms of folic acid every day for at least 3 months to reduce the risk of birth defects in the brain and spine. Research shows that daily folic acid reduces the risk of neural tube defects by 70%. Some foods, like cereals and grains, include folic acid but it’s best to get the necessary amount from a supplement.\nStop smoking and drinking alcohol. In addition to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, the use of tobacco and alcohol has been shown to increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\nWork to manage any medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure and thyroid disease.\nConsider any medication or supplements you’re currently taking and confirm with your doctor if they are safe for pregnancy. If not, discuss your options.\nAvoid contact with toxic substances or materials, including chemicals.",

Blood work to determine blood type, blood count and Rh factor is completed during the first visit, along with testing for certain viruses and sexually transmitted diseases.

There is also a higher risk of birth defects, intellectual and developmental issues for babies born to women with thyroid disease. Is pregnancy safe with hypothyroidism? If treated, yes. The problem is that while it’s not especially difficult to treat, it often goes undiagnosed. Many symptoms of hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s mimic first trimester complaints like fatigue, so a woman may not even know she has it until later in the pregnancy. Experts say that someone with a high risk, past history or symptoms of Hashimoto’s or other autoimmune diseases should have thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, and thyroid blood tests done prior to conception, and thyroid function during pregnancy should be checked every 6-8 weeks. Hashimoto’s after pregnancy can still be an issue, but TSH levels often adjust by the third trimester.",

    "question": "How does comprehensive chromosome screening work?",
    "answer": "The testing is performed on a few cells from a day 5 embryo, called a blastocyst, which has hatched and started to develop an early placenta. Several cells are sampled from the placenta and sent to a genetics lab so that the chromosomes can be counted. The blastocysts are cryopreserved, or frozen, for about a week until testing is complete. Embryo survival after freezing is about 98%. Only the embryos with the correct number of chromosomes are selected for transfer – typically a single embryo at one time – or will remain frozen until the intended parents decide to use them. By refining the embryo selection process, embryologists can truly narrow down the healthiest embryos that are most likely to result in an ongoing pregnancy. Preimplantation genetic testing can be done on the embryos to identify further issues, but CCS is often sufficient.",

    "question": "What is embryo donation?",
    "answer": "Embryo donation is a form of third party reproduction, a different version of sperm or egg donation. It allows a couple to experience pregnancy and become parents utilizing genetic material – in this case, fertilized embryos – provided by someone else. Often, when an intended parent undergoes in vitro fertilization, there will be multiple embryos remaining. Because technology has improved to the point that a single embryo transfer is the most effective and safest method, a couple may find that they have a surplus of healthy embryos they simply won’t use. The decision over what to do with these embryos can be challenging for many reasons; some couples decide that rather than discard what took so much time, effort and money to create, they’d like to give someone else a chance at a family. Embryos can be donated anonymously through programs at fertility clinics, while embryo donation is a more in-depth process that often involves an agency to help with matching and logistics. You may come across the word “snowflake” when exploring your options. What is snowflake adoption?

Get your doctor’s approval. Ask your doctor to review the medical history and potential risk factors. You can request medical and embryo records in order to obtain the most accurate information. Step 3. Sign a contract. Adopting an embryo is typically considered a property transfer, but your contract can be adjusted to language that reflects an adoption. Depending on your location, the adoption can be finalized in court. It’s generally not necessary. Step 4. Arrange transportation for the embryos. The clinic that is storing the frozen embryos will provide the information necessary to have them shipped to your fertility clinic.",

And without a mature egg to fertilize, it is impossible to achieve a pregnancy. Thirty percent of women’s infertility is related to ovulatory disorders such as early ovulation and anovulation, a condition in which ovulation doesn’t occur at all. In about half of the cases of anovulation, normal follicles aren’t even produced, which means an egg doesn’t have the opportunity to mature.",

  {
    "question": "Is there treatment for immature eggs in ovaries?",
    "answer": "Yes. Because specific hormones are responsible for the production and maturation of follicles, it is possible to mimic them. But first, your doctor will likely want to confirm if your eggs are immature by testing your follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level and your anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) level, which reflects your ovarian reserve. An ultrasound to check your antral follicle count is helpful too; while not always the case, research shows that the number of active antral follicles is a good indication of ovarian reserve. A normal number is 6 to 10; fewer than 6 indicates low ovarian reserve. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) often fall in this category due to the lack of hormones necessary for eggs to fully mature. In fact, 70% of ovulatory issues are related to PCOS. If you ultimately decide to undergo infertility treatment, your doctor will likely start a regimen of oral fertility medications, such as Letrozole or Clomid, to help stimulate the ovaries. Other alternatives include injectable fertility medications or gonadotropins. Gonadotropins contain follicle stimulation hormones (FSH), luteinizing hormones (LH) or a combination, and encourage the ovaries to produce more eggs. This is the protocol for egg donor medication, too. During the in vitro fertilization process (IVF), the stimulation protocol can be adjusted as necessary if it appears there are too many immature ova. This can improve the rate of maturation and, hopefully, increase the number of mature eggs that will be available at retrieval; this is why regular monitoring is so important. These drugs are used in addition to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the form of a trigger shot about 36 hours before egg retrieval. Whether you are going through the process yourself for a surrogate IVF cycle, or if you’re working with an egg donor, mature follicles are key to your future success.

    "answer": "Reciprocal IVF, sometimes referred to as partner IVF, co-IVF, shared motherhood or ROPA (reception of oocytes from partner), is exactly as it sounds: both partners have equal participation in the IVF process. One partner takes the first steps, undergoing all the necessary testing to harvest their eggs for retrieval. The second partner then has the fertilized embryo transferred to their uterus to carry and give birth to the baby. Is reciprocal IVF exclusive for lesbian couples? Not necessarily; it also allows trans men who have functioning ovaries or a uterus to participate.",

  {
    "question": "How long is the reciprocal IVF process?",
    "answer": "Reciprocal IVF is very similar to third party IVF, which is when an egg donor or surrogate is involved. One person spends several weeks undergoing genetic testing, a medical workup, and injectable fertility medication leading up to the first major milestone: the egg retrieval. Meanwhile, the second person is getting prepped for another milestone: the embryo transfer. Once the eggs have been retrieved, they are combined with sperm – either from an anonymous or known donor, in this case – to create embryos. The reproductive endocrinologist will then select the healthiest embryo to transfer. The entire process can vary in length depending on unforeseen medical issues, but it typically takes about two to three months.",

Some insurance carriers, however, do not cover the cost of reciprocal IVF unless it is a medical necessity. In those cases, the individual who is having their eggs retrieved is also expected to carry the baby. Including injectable medications, an IVF cycle with a fresh transfer typically costs between $15,000 and $20,000.

    "question": "What is the future of reciprocal IVF?",
    "answer": "In the past, same sex couples were limited to standard IUI or IVF; only one parent could be genetically related to the baby. Thanks to reciprocal IVF, both parents can play a crucial role in the creation and development of their child. While only one parent, with the help of donor sperm, is providing the genetic material, the other is able to experience a connection through pregnancy and childbirth. Studies actually show that cells can cross the placental barrier and introduce the carrying mother’s DNA to the baby, and vice versa. While it doesn’t impact the baby’s genetic makeup, it’s still a special link that the two can share. Technological advancements have many wondering: can two female eggs “mix” to create an embryo? While we’re still a long way off from that reality, the concept of creating egg or sperm from stem cells is something scientists are exploring. In theory, the cell from one woman could be used to produce sperm, which would then fertilize her partner’s egg. It’s truly fascinating to consider all the ways technology helps people realize their dreams of parenthood.

Had I waited to share those details, that new and surprising knowledge may have defined them and/or changed their view of themselves, either as children or as donor-conceived adults. I’d much rather their unique accomplishments delineate them via their own choices. What I’ve seen since I’ve been working in third-party fertility is that the extended families who originally had concerns about the origins of their future grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins, etc. don’t care one bit about the biology the moment the child comes into the world. The genetics and biology are all obscured by their overwhelming adoration for that baby. They argue over who gets to hold the baby next and for how long. I give all of the parents the same advice – make sure you have a timer on hand and set it for 15 minutes. Once it dings, you get to decide which lucky person gets to hold your son/daughter next. So – do you tell your child about the egg donor? I strongly encourage it, and research supports this decision too. My children don’t ever question that I’m their parent. I believe that the people who contributed to my ability to become my sons’ mother deserve to be honored and mentioned.

That is true whether the biological mother or a surrogate gives birth, so the initial reporting of the birth to the Office of Vital Records is the same. The details from there, however, can vary; while the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics has standard recommended forms to document births, states are free to create their own forms that may look different and require different content. These discrepancies from state to state – and in some cases, county to county – mean it is imperative that you have a firm understanding of the laws where your child will be born. Typically, the birth certificate forms are completed by the person who attended the birth or a hospital administrator. The forms are then forwarded to a local or state registrar to be safely stored. In a surrogacy birth, these forms may need to be adjusted so that they legally reflect the parents’ names and not the surrogate’s.",

    "answer": "The process of registering a surrogacy birth often starts long before the child is born. Some states allow what is known as a pre-birth order; this document establishes the intended parent(s) as the legal parents of the child. Meg Ledebuhr, Esq., Director of Legal Services at ConceiveAbilities describes a pre-birth order as “the gold standard in fertility law.” The documents associated with a pre-birth order are typically started sometime during the second trimester of the surrogate pregnancy and signed at least two (2) months prior to the birth. “The earlier you can establish a pre-birth order, the better,” Meg says. “It’s ideal to get legal parentage locked in during the second or third trimester in the event the baby comes early.” A pre-birth order may direct the hospital to release the baby to the intended parents after discharge and/or order the state’s Office of Vital Records to name the intended parents on the baby’s birth certificate. Some states, however, do not issue pre-birth orders and instead require a post-birth order to grant legal parentage to the child’s parents. The Office of Vital Records may require the hard data, or the “facts of the birth,” meaning the surrogate’s name is initially on the birth certificate. A post-birth order changes that to reflect the correct parentage.",

    "answer": "Also called a uterosalpingography, the HSG test is a procedure that looks at your fallopian tubes and uterus. HSG allows your doctor to more accurately investigate the shape of the fallopian tubes and uterine cavity by inserting a radio-opaque material, often a dye, into the cervical canal. If the tubes are blocked the dye will spill into the abdominal cavity. Undergoing an HSG has also been seen to improve chances of conception for a short period following the procedure. It will also indicate if the blockage is distal, at the end of the fallopian tube, or proximal, located at the junction of the tube and the uterus. If the fallopian tube is blocked somewhere, the sperm can’t reach the egg or the fertilized egg can’t get to the uterus – meaning you can’t get pregnant.

If it shows tubal blockage, your doctor will likely perform a laparoscopy. Depending on the severity, in vitro fertilization may be recommended, because this can help you conceive by completely bypassing the fallopian tubes. Interestingly, some women actually do have greater success getting pregnant naturally after HSG – in fact, the chances can increase as much as 25% for up to three months after the procedure.

The criteria for diagnosing PCOS can vary and has even changed as more is learned about the disorder, but your doctor will typically look for two out of three of these signs: Polycystic ovaries, confirmed by ultrasound\nIrregular or absent menstrual cycles\nBlood test confirmation or physical signs of abnormally high levels of androgens (severe acne, excessive hair growth) Testing for hormone levels, lipid levels, and blood sugar to determine insulin resistance are common with a PCOS diagnosis. Doctors often prescribe birth control to help manage acne and hair growth if a woman is not trying to get pregnant. If pregnancy is the goal, your doctor will have options for that too.",

    "question": "Can I get pregnant with PCOS naturally?",
    "answer": "Because it is a disorder that affects hormones, conceiving naturally with PCOS can be a challenge. The abnormal hormone levels can cause problems with a woman’s menstrual cycle, which means irregular menstrual cycles and unpredictable ovulation. Some women, however, can get pregnant with PCOS and regular periods, but only if they are also ovulating regularly. Lifestyle changes can have an impact on cycle regularity. Some research indicates that moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, combined with a healthy diet can improve insulin resistance, regulate periods and, yes, improve chances of conception. In fact, one study showed that women can improve their hormonal balance through basic cardio exercise. More than 40 percent of the women in the study started ovulating, and over half restored their menstrual cycle after 12 weeks.",

    "question": "Are there alternatives for getting pregnant with PCOS?",
    "answer": "For some women, achieving regular ovulation for conception may require more intervention. How do you get pregnant with PCOS? Often, the answer is similar to anyone who is experiencing anovulation. Your doctor may prescribe Clomid, an oral pill that helps induce ovulation by stimulating the hormones that support the growth and release of a mature egg. Clomid has an 80 percent ovulation success rate, though rates of subsequent pregnancy vary based on other factors like age and egg quality. Letrozole, which is actually a cancer medication, has also been shown to induce ovulation. If oral pills aren’t successful, the next step is typically a round of injectable fertility medications called gonadotropins. Many women with PCOS will get pregnant with one of these treatments, but intrauterine insemination (IUI), where a catheter is utilized to transfer sperm directly into the uterus, or in vitro fertilization could be the answer for more challenging cases. Sometimes PCOS isn’t the only issue at play preventing a pregnancy; a reproductive endocrinologist is the best resource to determine your individual treatment protocol. While it’s rare that someone with PCOS alone requires an egg donor, other factors such as age and egg quality could make her a good candidate for egg donation.",

    "answer": "From a biological perspective, science tells us that the best time for a woman to have children is in her late teens to early twenties. The reproductive system and other functions are at their peak, and eggs are still fresh. The reality, though, is that many women choose to wait. The risk in delaying pregnancy is diminished ovarian reserve: ASRM reports that a 30-year-old woman has about a 20 percent chance of conceiving each month; a 40-year-old’s chances dip closer to 5 percent. Between fewer available eggs and a higher risk for genetic abnormalities, it can be more difficult for a woman to have a successful pregnancy beyond the age of 35. A woman’s biological clock begins to speed up around this time; it’s recommended that a woman over 35 see a reproductive endocrinologist if she’s unsuccessful in conceiving after 6 months, while a woman under 35 should have a workup after one year.",

In an attempt to circumvent diminished ovarian reserve and age-related genetic abnormalities, many women in their 20s and 30s are considering egg freezing. In this relatively new procedure, eggs are retrieved and cryopreserved so that, in theory, they can eventually be thawed and fertilized with sperm for an IVF transfer even years down the line.

    "question": "Is it safe to donate eggs?",
    "answer": "Yes. There is virtually no evidence indicating long-term risk for a woman who donates her eggs. Several studies actually prove egg donation misconceptions to be incorrect, such as potential long-term risk for ovarian cancer related to fertility drugs. Some of the medications an egg donor can expect to take include: Lupron – Also known as Leuprolide Acetate. It is used to control female hormone levels and prevent the release of eggs. Research shows Lupron is harmless to humans and leaves the body hours after discontinued usage. Ganirelix acetate or Cetrotide – Also known as GNRH Antagonist, it may be used as a substitute for Lupron to prevent eggs from maturing and releasing. Follicle Stimulating Hormones (FSH or Gonadotropins) – Also known as Gonal F, Bravelle, Follistim, Menopur, or Repronex. FSH is the same hormone in a female body used to mature her eggs during the menstrual cycle. Just like any medical procedure or use of medication, there are inherent risks. Preventative care and treatment are constantly evolving, though, which minimizes those short-term risks. Thorough education and regular monitoring at the fertility clinic during the medication cycle also help prevent potential complications.",

Others note minor side effects from the medication, such as headaches, mood swings, bloating, and temporary weight gain. There is a low risk of a donor developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). This happens when the body over responds to FSH, causing enlarged ovaries. While IVF clinics are extremely careful with medication protocol to avoid this condition (it only affects 1-5% of IVF cases) it can be treated with a procedure to drain the excess fluid from the ovaries. For this reason, egg donors must take care to follow instructions precisely and avoid strenuous activity while they are cycling to protect their ovaries from twisting or tearing.",

What are the desired potential medical interventions? Who will hold the baby first? Exploring important questions such as these encourage both the surrogate and the intended parents to learn more about their available options. Every hospital is a little different, so this is also the time to inquire about pain relief options, visitors, and specific routines or protocol they may already have in place. It’s much better to be aware of these things going in – no one wants any unnecessary surprises when emotions are already running high during labor.",

    "question": "Is there an emotional transfer of a surrogate-born baby?",
    "answer": "At first glance, it would seem obvious that a surrogate mother would get attached to the child. After all, she’s carrying a baby for months and will eventually give birth – an incredibly emotional process. But for a gestational carrier (GC), that doesn’t take away from the ultimate purpose of her journey. A three-time surrogate and ConceiveAbilities’ Surrogate Acceptance Coordinator, Kristina Fabis, offers this perspective: “My pregnancy was my duty, to protect it as if it was my own. All three pregnancies, it seemed like it was my job.” Just like any woman who pursues surrogacy, she had to really consider her motivation. Ultimately, “that was something that really stood out: it’s such a duty. It was never mine to give away. I gave back.” Lori Jurecko, LSW, has the unique perspective of a mental health professional, ConceiveAbilities Match Manager and former surrogate. While her intention and motivation were clear from the beginning, she recalls how challenging the concept could be for others. A relative even tried to talk her out of it, saying “once you have this baby it’s going to be so hard for you to give it up.” While Lori understood it was coming from a place of love and concern, her resolve didn’t waver. “I never had a trace of concern because I wasn’t having my own baby,” she explains. “It all comes down to the motivation.”",

  {
    "question": "How does surrogacy affect the child?",
    "answer": "Research suggests that attachment begins before a baby is born. So while the gestational carrier may not develop those bonds, the child will naturally feel an attachment to the only environment they’ve known. But just like any other newborn, a child born via surrogacy will be introduced to a new world and, with the help of his or her parents, can quickly adapt. Preparation for the emotional transfer begins long before the child is born. Some intended parents are grieving losses, and that takes time to process. It’s important to address unresolved grief so that it’s possible to focus on the baby’s needs and their bonding as a new family. Taking an active role in the preparation for the baby will help with this emotional transfer after the birth, as will creating a birth plan. With the help of their match manager, the intended parents and surrogate will discuss how they hope the baby’s first moments will go – whether it’s the immediate transfer to a specific parent, if it includes skin-to-skin contact, and even breastfeeding with the parent.",

He or she will likely be able to provide some referrals. If you’re utilizing third party reproduction – that is, if you’re using an egg or sperm donor – or if you’re working with a gestational carrier, your clinic may require you to speak with a mental health professional. In that case, they will either have a qualified counselor available on staff or they will refer you to someone who has experience with the emotional aspects of the process.

However, the truth is that surrogacy can be used by any parent, as long as they conduct the proper research, have a sound background, and are determined to start their family. Same-sex couples are biologically incapable of producing offspring, but through surrogacy, their dream can be fully realized. Not only can they have a child, but they can have a genetic connection to their offspring. The same goes for families affected by infertility. Some people choose surrogacy due to a health condition preventing them from carrying a pregnancy, or have previously had a complicated, high-risk pregnancy. After miscarriages and other setbacks, families can use surrogacy to start their family in a way they weren’t able to in the past. In cultures such as China or Israel, preserving the bloodline is a family tradition. Though some opt for adoption, many parents choose surrogacy because it allows them to maintain a genetic link to their children.",

    "answer": "Yes – for your protection. Intended parents can not only guarantee that they have the means to cover the cost of surrogacy, but they can also feel assured that their funds are being held safely until the appropriate time to compensate their surrogate. In turn, the gestational carrier knows from the outset that the necessary funds are in place for her as the process moves along. Unfortunately, there have been situations where deceitful agencies have duped clients out of thousands of dollars. While it’s incredibly rare, unsavory business practices can happen – and it’s often with agencies that have no transparent protocol when it comes to payments. When hopeful individuals are involved, and large sums of money are exchanging hands in multiple payments, any industry is at risk for deceitful practices.

    "answer": "A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. The decision to have the procedure may not be an easy one, and sometimes it’s not a choice at all. Whether it’s due to severe pain or a cancer diagnosis, this major surgery is likely to be thoroughly researched before a final decision is made. Sometimes, in the case of a severe infection or excessive bleeding after childbirth, an emergency hysterectomy may be performed. Typically, women with severe uterine fibroids, endometriosis (where tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside of the uterus on the ovaries) or adenomyosis (where tissue grows inside of the uterus where it doesn’t belong) are candidates for hysterectomy, as are women who have been diagnosed with cancer of the uterus, ovary, cervix, or endometrium (which is another word for the uterine lining). There are three main kinds of hysterectomies: A supracervical or subtotal hysterectomy, where only the upper part of the uterus is removed and the cervix stays in place\nA total hysterectomy, where the entire uterus and cervix are removed\nA radical hysterectomy, where the entire uterus, tissue on the sides of the uterus, the cervix, and the top part of the vagina are removed",

    "question": "Can I donate eggs after a hysterectomy?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible to have an egg retrieval after a hysterectomy. While you would likely not qualify as an egg donor for someone else, your fertility clinic can explore options with you for your own IVF cycle. Your antral follicle count, or ovarian volume, are checked to judge the likelihood of a successful retrieval. You have an ovarian ultrasound to determine the condition and location of your ovaries, as they sometimes move after a hysterectomy. Your hormone levels are also monitored to determine where you are in your cycle so that egg stimulation and retrieval can be appropriately scheduled. If your ovaries need to be removed during the hysterectomy, you can explore the option of harvesting your eggs first. This option will likely depend on your age; just as you are not able to donate eggs at 40 or later, you’ll want to consider the quality of any eggs retrieved. If they are healthy, they can either be frozen for a later attempt at fertilization or they can be fertilized right away with your partner or a donor’s sperm. The embryos can then be frozen until you’re ready to attempt IVF with a gestational carrier.",

    "question": "How much do egg donors make?",
    "answer": "We believe that every woman should be fairly compensated for the time, effort and inconvenience required of the donation process. Starting pay for ConceiveAbilities egg donors begins at $10,000. Compensation depends on a number of factors, including the donor’s location, her donation history, and her ethnic diversity. In particular, Asian, and East Indian donors are usually more sought after. ConceiveAbilities’ donors have used their compensation towards supporting their college tuition, traveling the world, donating to charity, purchasing a home, or starting a business.",

However, it is good practice to understand the potential short-term side effects and risks that accompany the process. Medication side effects – As mentioned in the previous section, some of the medication associated with egg donation can lead to headache, moodiness, fatigue or bloating. Some may lead to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but this is rare and very treatable. Antibiotics – There may be antibiotics involved to prevent bacterial infections, and some patients have an allergic reaction. Consult your doctor if you think you may have an allergy to antibiotics. Blood-drawing and injections – As with most needles, there may be mild discomfort and a risk of bruising from the blood-drawing process. Pregnancy – If a donor has unprotected intercourse after the retrieval process, there is a likelihood of pregnancy because the donor is on medication that enhances fertility.",

    "answer": "You can expect the cost of surrogacy to start at around $100,000, but you may ultimately pay $240,000 or more when all is said and done. There are many different factors and variables to consider, like using an egg donor that can increase costs. When you factor in the gestational carrier’s compensation, psychological evaluations, medical exams and screenings, the agency fee, the IVF fees, legal fees, insurance, and miscellaneous expenses, it’s easy to see how it adds up quickly. There is also the possibility your surrogate will be placed on bed rest or require a cesarean-section, meaning she may receive reimbursement for lost wages and things like childcare and housekeeping.",

    "question": "Why is therapy important for the surrogate’s partner?",
    "answer": "While the initial meeting with the agency’s mental health professional will help you and your partner to explore some of these issues and questions in more detail, some find that they need additional support throughout – or that certain factors don’t even arise until much later. Surrogacy is a complex and very personal process. Few things are more intimate than carrying a baby; when someone’s partner is carrying a baby for someone else, it may be difficult for them to know how they fit into the picture. According to Greg, whose wife was a gestational carrier twice, “Husbands do need support, even though they might think, ‘I’m a guy, I don’t need that.’ It’s a very emotional thing, having a child. Especially when you know all the contracts behind it, that it’s not your child.” Still, he adds, “When you see your wife give birth, there’s some emotional attachment there that you need to talk about.” That emotional attachment is something that is addressed with the gestational carrier from the very beginning; she has support from the agency, her match manager, and a surrogacy support group to help her address these very natural feelings. For many partners, therapy is a beneficial way to sort through similarly complicated emotions.",

    "question": "How do I find a therapist for my partner?",
    "answer": "Once you and your partner recognize that therapy would be a helpful tool, there are a few ways to find a good therapist. Not all therapy is created equal, so Psychology Today offers a few tips: Ask family and friends. In this case, talk to people close to the process like your match manager and other gestational carriers. Your agency is there to support both you and your partner in any way you need during the surrogacy process, and that includes identifying ongoing counseling and therapy. Ask other surrogates too; she and her partner may have experienced a similar situation and can speak to their own therapist for a referral list.\nShop online. Psychology Today suggests taking a look at their Therapy Directory as well BetterHelp for options in your area and even via electronic counseling.\nCall them. Once you’ve found someone to contact, pick up the phone and give them a call. Have some questions ready about their background and their specialty to get an idea if they are qualified to help your specific needs. The cost of therapy will vary depending on your therapist, location, income level, and insurance. Most therapists will charge anywhere from $75 to $150 per session out of pocket. BetterHelp’s goal is to find affordable counseling options that can be as low as $35 per session. And while it’s difficult to say exactly how long a surrogate’s partner will have to go to therapy, most couples can confidently say that both the time and cost are worth it. Not only will it help your partner process their own feelings, but it can also help them to be a more solid source of support for you. Travis’ advice to a surrogate’s spouse is to “treat your wife with care, patience, love, and understanding, as this is scary for both and you can’t be selfish. Just remember the happiness the couple will experience when your wife gives birth to their baby.”",

    "question": "What is RhoGAM and what is its purpose?",
    "answer": "RhoGAM, short for Rho (D) Immune Globulin, is the brand name of a sterile solution made from human blood plasma and given to Rh-negative women in the form of an injection. Rh, or Rhesus, is a protein on the surface of red blood cells that most people naturally have. If you have the protein, you are considered Rh-positive. If not, you are Rh-negative, a trait shared by 15 percent of the US population. And while it generally doesn’t matter if you’re Rh status is positive or negative, pregnancy is a time when Rh status matters, especially if you are Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive. When a gestational carrier who is Rh-negative receives a RhoGAM shot, she is preventing her blood system from potentially attacking the fetal blood.",

  {
    "question": "How does a RhoGAM shot work?",
    "answer": "A RhoGAM shot acts almost as a vaccination, which introduces the body to a dosage of a virus that is too small to cause serious illness. Thus, the body learns to fight the virus effectively and prevents major reaction or sickness if exposed later which is called Rh sensitization. In this case, a RhoGAM shot contains antibodies to Rh-positive blood, but not in a high enough amount that it will hurt the fetus. When the gestational carrier’s body detects antibodies from an infant’s Rh-positive blood, which can happen especially during delivery, her immune system reacts as if it has already fought the foreign Rh-positive red blood cells. Since her immune system doesn’t react to the fetal blood, any harm to the baby is fully averted. A miracle you might say.",

    "question": "What is the biological clock?",
    "answer": "While there is nothing physical ticking inside your body preparing to chime when it’s time to have a baby, there is an innate mechanism deep in the brain that controls physiological things like sleep, growth, and reproduction. Circadian rhythm, for example, is part of this clock and helps your body adjust accordingly to its surroundings. It can also, according to some, cause a hormonal urge for parenthood. A 2011 study showed that both women and men can experience a “sudden, visceral and almost irresistible urge to have a baby.”",

  {
    "question": "How does the biological clock affect pregnancy?",
    "answer": "In addition to helping your body recover from jet lag, the biological clock can indicate when it’s time to start planning for a pregnancy. As the body ages, so do a woman’s eggs. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine reports that a 30-year-old woman has about a 20 percent chance of conceiving each month; a 40-year-old woman’s chances are closer to 5 percent. A diminishing ovarian reserve coupled with more genetic issues often prevent a woman from getting – and staying – pregnant. In the past, it was the norm for women as young as their late teens to start having children. Biologically, the best time is late teens to early twenties, according to John Mirowsky, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin. “Oocytes are fresh and the body’s reproductive and other systems are at a youthful peak.” However, the study showed a variety of ages that could be considered “best” to have a baby – for example, the optimum age at first birth in regards to the mother’s long-term physical well-being was 31 years old. The best age for the mother’s long-term health and mortality was 34. Overall, Mirowsky said, women can “reasonably expect optimal health outcomes from delaying motherhood into their thirties.” Still, other science shows that 35 is the age at which fertility begins to sharply decline. A woman who has unsuccessfully tried to conceive for a year or more under the age of 35, but for just 6 months if over the age of 35, should meet with a reproductive endocrinologist to determine what, if any, support should be utilized. It’s also true that some fertility clinics will work with a patient to retrieve eggs for her own IVF transfer into her early 40s. This is typical with the stipulation that the embryos undergo comprehensive chromosomal screening or preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) to determine their quality before implantation. When it comes to working with an egg donor, though, the age range is much more conservative; it’s important to mitigate as many risks as possible – including the quality and quantity of the eggs.",

    "question": "Are men affected by the biological clock?",
    "answer": "It’s a long-held belief that men can successfully have children at just about any age. And while their fertility window is much wider than a woman’s, sperm is most fertile before the age of 40. Male fertility starts an overall decline at 40; the volume of a man’s semen and sperm motility decreases continually between the ages of 20 and 80. Not only that, but the quality of the sperm that is available begins to deteriorate too; the risk of miscarriage is twice as high for women whose male partner is over 45 than for those whose partners are under 25.",

Some agencies will accept candidates as young as 19 and up through their early 30s, but it is women in their early to mid-20s who possess the ideal physiology for the most successful outcome. Applicants will ask, “why can’t I donate eggs at age 36? People tell me I look 10 years younger!” While that’s probably true, the fact is that our eggs don’t age as gracefully – and age makes a big difference in their health and quality. Still, it’s also true that some fertility clinics will work with a patient to retrieve eggs for her own IVF transfer into her early 40s.

With approximately 10,000 egg donation cycles each year, and with clear guidelines put in place by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the track record on safety is excellent. As with any medication, there is always a risk of side effects from egg donation medications. Each donor responds differently to the protocol – some may experience several side effects, while others will have none at all. You can find a more comprehensive list of potential egg donor medications here. Not only have the medications been found to be safe, studies have shown that women who donate their eggs aren’t harming their chances of future pregnancies. A Belgian study looked at a group of 60 women who had donated eggs; 54 became pregnant within a year of trying to conceive, with three more becoming pregnant within 18 months. The remaining three women were able to conceive with fertility treatments, and two of those were due to male-factor issues.

While a variety of fertility medications are necessary as part of an IVF cycle, they can also disrupt the body’s natural rhythm. Estradiol in IVF supports natural estrogen needs, thickening the uterine lining so that it is prepared for implantation.

The process can technically be done with a surrogate, but this is rare because it would make her the biological mother. It can be done without medication, though fertility drugs like Gonadotropin or clomiphene are often used to induce ovulation and increase the number of eggs available. Monitoring is done in the days leading up to the IUI to confirm the eggs have matured. A semen sample is provided so that it can be washed, separating the semen from the seminal fluid to maximize the number of sperm cells available for fertilization.",

    "answer": "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) refers to testing specifically when one or both parents are known to have a genetic abnormality, while Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) refers to the screening of embryos for general chromosomal issues. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) states, “techniques are constantly evolving and changing to be more accurate, easier to run, and give more information.” The terminology is changing, too. According to The International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, all testing will be referred to as Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT). What has been called PGD is technically now PGT-M, and what was PGS is now PGT-A (aneuploidies) or PGT-SR (structural rearrangements). As ASRM points out, all women will have some eggs that are chromosomally abnormal, and all men will have some sperm that are chromosomally abnormal. Age and health history can have an impact, so the technique is used to identify genetic defects in an embryo that was created through IVF. Rather than waiting for diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling during pregnancy, certain abnormalities and disorders can be detected within the cells before the embryo is ever transferred into the uterus.",

Today, the process is even more streamlined: Using egg and sperm, embryos are created in the IVF lab and allowed to grow, typically for about 3 to 5 days. During this time, at least one cell is removed from each embryo and sent for testing. The cellular DNA is tested for abnormalities, the final results of which may take about a week.The embryos with abnormalities are usually discarded, while the others are either transferred or frozen for later use.",

    "question": "What are the different types of surrogacy?",

  {
    "question": "What is traditional surrogacy?",
    "answer": "A traditional surrogate is the biological mother of the child; her egg is combined with the intended father’s or donor’s sperm. This is the type of surrogacy that has been practiced the longest. Before modern technology allowed for the creation of embryos outside the womb, it was the only way to conceive via surrogate mother. Now that the means do exist to use the intended mother’s or a donor’s egg, traditional surrogacy is much more rare. The potential legal and emotional implications are often enough of a deterrent; there is little protection to prevent a traditional surrogate from claiming the child as her own, or for a surrogate to be left responsible for medical costs for herself and the child. With modern surrogacy, the surrogate does not use her own egg and has no DNA or genetic relation to the child she is carrying. Learn more about the difference between a traditional surrogate and a gestational surrogate. In some states, traditional surrogacy is actually against the law.",

    "answer": "Modern gestational surrogacy is the most successful fertility treatment. Science now allows a surrogate mother to carry another woman’s egg with relative ease: she is known as a gestational surrogate or gestational carrier. This is the most common form of surrogacy and provides the most solid legal protection for both intended parents and the surrogate. This is the only type of surrogacy ConceiveAbilities Surrogacy Agency practices. With gestational surrogacy, the surrogate mother carries a child for another person who cannot. The surrogate does not share DNA with the child and is not the genetic mother. The embryo that is implanted in the surrogate has no DNA or genetic relation to the surrogate.",

In most surrogacy arrangements, the surrogate receives surrogacy compensation for her time and effort on top of general costs related to the pregnancy. Altruistic surrogates are typically helping someone they know, such as a close friend or family member, and will likely only receive reimbursement for medical costs.

    "question": "What is independent surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Much like traditional surrogacy, independent surrogacy runs a whole host of legal risks. An independent surrogate is working without the support and expertise of a surrogacy agency – often going through the process for someone she already knows. And while it may seem reasonable to take the agency out of the equation, you can never underestimate the value of a knowledgeable third party. When the process gets complicated and emotions run high, the agency is there as an added layer of support and protection for both parties. Surrogacy is too complicated a process to go it alone; from medical decisions to insurance to compensation, a reputable agency has truly been there, done that and can find a solution for even the most challenging situation.

    "question": "What is prolactin?",
    "answer": "Prolactin, also known as luteotropic hormone or luteotropin, is a protein found in both females and males. The most common function is enabling females to produce milk. It is produced in the anterior pituitary gland, as well as the uterus, brain, breasts, prostate, adipose tissue, skin and immune cells. While it typically is not a hormone we hear much about, according to the Endocrine Society’s Hormone Health Network, an overabundance of prolactin in the blood causes hyperprolactinemia. Side effects of high prolactin levels and subsequent hyperprolactinemia can include irregular menstruation as well as estrogen and testosterone deficiencies that make it difficult to conceive.",

    "answer": "If high levels of prolactin are found pre-pregnancy, it can be an indicator of deeper hormonal issues. The normal production of estrogen and progesterone may be impacted, which means ovulation can become irregular or even stop completely. Hyperprolactinemia can indicate other health issues are at play as well, such as pituitary tumors, hypothyroidism, liver or kidney disease, or anorexia. If prolactin levels are high, it’s important to address these health issues before attempting to conceive, whether naturally or via fertility treatment. Hyperprolactinemia is reversible and, with proper attention, it’s relatively easy to return to normal prolactin levels for pregnancy.",

So exactly what does progesterone do during pregnancy? According to The National Infertility Association, it serves several key functions: Before pregnancy: Progesterone prepares the uterus. The ovaries begin producing progesterone after ovulation to thicken the uterine lining – ultimately creating a healthy, supportive space for the embryo to grow. During early pregnancy: Progesterone remains important to ensure a healthy environment for the growing fetus. By about week 8 of the pregnancy, the placenta is developed enough to take over progesterone production.",

    "question": "Is a Surrogate Mother Related to the Child?",
    "answer": "In compensated surrogacy arrangements in the United States, a previously fertilized embryo from the intended parents is transferred to a surrogate. Still, some wonder if the surrogate’s blood passes through the heart of the fetus and, if so, does that mean she is, in turn, passing on her DNA. And this question remains: is a surrogate mother related to the child? The answer is no: the baby has its own blood flowing through its veins, with the DNA of the egg fertilized by the sperm it was created from. After the embryo is successfully implanted in the gestational carrier’s uterus, it continues to grow there during a successful pregnancy. Also developing in the uterus is the placenta. This is an incredibly important part of the pregnancy because it not only nourishes the growing baby, but it also functions as a filter. It only allows certain things to cross through it, acting as a gatekeeper to prevent blood as well as DNA from passing between the baby and surrogate. Studies now show that cells actually can cross the placental barrier and introduce the surrogate’s DNA to the baby, or vice versa. But is it enough to impact the baby’s genetic makeup? Will the baby inherit the surrogate mother’s characteristics? Absolutely not. There is not nearly enough DNA passing through the placenta to impact the child; the placenta is a truly effective filter.",

She may also need to continue use of progesterone for several months to thicken the lining of the uterus, helping it implant and continue to develop. From that point on, an IVF pregnancy will progress just as a traditional pregnancy would.

There are no silly questions. Never feel embarrassed to broach certain subjects. Your nurse and doctor have heard it all before.\nBe honest about your own and your family’s health histories. They will all be talked over very in great detail and it is best to be up front with clinic staff.\nLastly, be prepared for a long day. Most egg donors say that the appointment lasted longer than they expected. Prepare by bringing a light snack in your bag, a book, music, and a water bottle. Again, staying hydrated is always a good idea.",

    "question": "Should I tell my child about their conception via egg donation?",
    "answer": "While each parent has their own perspective or philosophy on revealing a child’s history, we recommend being as honest and straightforward as possible with your children from early on. Here are some reasons why not telling your child could be problematic: A confused sense of self and identity. Children may question where they came from at an early age, particularly if they have different genetic traits or features (such as an Asian baby being born to a white, gay couple). The longer the truth is covered up or postponed, the more doubtful the child may be about who they are and their place in the world.\nHiding the truth is a difficult game. Crafting elaborate stories, or asking multiple friends and family to participate in some charade takes a lot of time and effort compared to telling the truth.\nIf the child finds out in another way, they may display intense distrust of their parents. It’s happened before: a family friend may casually slip and mention the egg donor or surrogacy origin, and the child may feel traumatized to find their world is far different than what they believed.\nThe risk of inaccurate medical data. Children who do not know their genetic background may run into medical issues down the line, since they may not fully understand their family’s medical history.",

    "question": "How should I tell my child about surrogacy?",
    "answer": "Good question, and one we’ve heard before. In our experience, here are the common steps we recommend in having the first conversations around egg donation and surrogacy. Prepare your conversation. Refrain from impulsive commentary or dialogue. Take your time to think through the most sensitive, easy-to-understand terminology, depending on their age and understanding of the world. If they are young, try to use short, familiar words and even use a children’s book to convey your ideas. Explain that some mothers are just wired in a different way and cannot have a baby like everyone else. However, these women are still mothers through what they say and do for their baby. Read our post on our top 5 books to explain surrogacy. If they are more mature, you might want to explain the various causes of infertility, and how infertility is actually highly common for women across the United States. Find a quiet time and place.A big part of preparing the conversation is finding the right setting. Try and pick a time when there are no distractions. After school, or on a weekend morning is ideal because this is when your child is most attentive. You want to make sure they take you seriously and listen to you carefully.\nUse simple language and tools. Don’t assume your child has the same vocabulary or worldview as you do. Avoid jargon and technical language: there’s no need to get into the specifics of In-Vitro Fertilization or the causes of infertility. Just explain the process using simple terms such as “pregnancy,” “baby,” and “mommy.” Again, use the examples set by children’s books to convey an easy-to-understand message.\nListen to their questions. Your child may not understand at first, and may ask what an egg donor or a surrogate means or if they are not your “real” child. Listen, pause and think of your response, then answer it as clearly and succinctly as you can. Constantly remind them that they are still your children, you are still their mother/parent, and that your love for them is the same. Assure them that they are just like any other kid in school.",

    "question": "What is the actual pregnancy like?",
    "answer": "“It was amazing. It was beautiful. It was heartbreaking. It was empowering. It was humbling. It was flawed. It was perfect… I’m just afraid I won’t be able to put the correct words together to adequately describe the birth and how it was for me.”\n\nDana, writer of Return to Senders. How can one accurately share the experience of carrying someone else’s child, the highs and lows with each week, and the final moment of delivering the baby? How can a few words capture those private, intimate moments? No one can answer that for sure. But there are blogs worth visiting that outline a surrogate’s journey. You can find our list in the additional resources section below.",

    "question": "What if the surrogate becomes too attached and wants to keep the baby?",
    "answer": "Because the surrogate’s role in the match process is to carry and deliver the family’s child, parents sometimes voice concerns that the surrogate might become too attached and change her mind. “We do not, in any way, shape, or form consider this our baby. We are very aware from the get-go that this is your baby. And we’re happy about that. Think about it this way, a surrogate is very capable of having her own children. If she wanted to have a baby, it’s a fairly simple process. We would certainly choose to have our own baby if having one was what we desired.”\n\nJeni, from Love Makes A Family, a blog about surrogate journeys. The truth is that surrogates are not interested in keeping the baby. They understand that the baby does not belong to them. Before each match, we conduct psychological evaluations to look at each surrogate’s motivation, assess for coercion, and ensure they are highly qualified. We only want to match surrogates with intended parents that we would trust with our own children.",

    "question": "What is a miscarriage?",
    "answer": "According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), miscarriages (sometimes also called early pregnancy loss) are the “loss of a pregnancy during the first 13 weeks of pregnancy,” or the first trimester. Miscarriages are surprisingly common. ACOG believes that roughly 10% of known pregnancies end in a miscarriage. Some doctors believe that figure is much higher. “I tell women they’re very common, and potentially up to a third of women will experience a miscarriage at some point in their lives,” says Siobhan Dolan, MD, MPH, professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Women’s Health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center.",

    "question": "What are the symptoms of a miscarriage?",
    "answer": "Bleeding and cramping are the most common signs of an impending miscarriage. Some other signs include back or abdominal pain. These are also frequent symptoms of early pregnancy, so it’s important to contact your doctor to conduct some tests to be sure. Usually these involve an ultrasound to check the baby’s health or a test for low hormone levels.",

  {
    "question": "What happens after the diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Once the doctor confirms the miscarriage, the priority is to empty the uterus. If there was heavy bleeding leading up to the miscarriage, then this usually means that all fetal tissue was cleared. More often, the miscarriage is “incomplete,” meaning that the tissue still needs to be expelled. There are three methods to do this: Expectant ManagementSome women may opt to wait for the pregnancy to expel itself naturally. Expectant management refers to a clinician monitoring a woman’s condition, instead of immediately taking action. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. After this time, the body should return to its regular menstrual cycle. Surgery (D&C)Doctors may also suggest a minor surgical operation where the fetus and placenta are scraped from the uterus. Dilation and curettage, or D&C, allows the woman to know exactly when the process takes place, unlike with medication, which is somewhat unclear. MedicationIn more complicated situations, the doctor may need to prescribe medication to assist with the expulsion of the pregnancy. Mifepristone and Misoprostol are just a few examples, but there are various types that can be used. Medication is less intrusive, but also gives you less control compared to D&C. The best approach depends on a number of factors, such as the relative risk involved and the state of the miscarriage.",

    "question": "How do I breastfeed my surrogate-born baby?",
    "answer": "1. Talk to the doctors at the hospital. The first thing you’ll want to do is communicate your desire to breastfeed to the doctors at the hospital of delivery. This will prepare the delivery team to feed the baby by cup or finger feeding if you cannot nurse the baby immediately after the birth. 2. Take hormones to produce breast milk. About 3 or 4 months before the baby’s birth, you should begin taking Estrogen and Progesterone, two hormones that will help you produce breast milk. In some cases, birth control may also be acceptable. Take these hormones up until at least 6 weeks before the birth. 3. Replace hormones with supplements. Closer to the pregnancy, your doctor may recommend taking herbal supplements and medication that will continue the production of breast milk. 4. Buy a pump and start pumping. After taking supplements, you should purchase a breast pump. During the day, you should pump every two hours, and during the night, every 3 hours. For more information on best practices for operating a pump, read Ask Lenore’s webpage on the topic. 5. Supplement your milk. Not all women will be able to produce the right amount of milk to sustain their child. Purchase a Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) to help your baby get the right amount of nutrition. Simply pour donated breast milk (or your own) into the container, and then tape the tubes to your chest. The SNS will use both the breast milk and the supplemental milk to ensure your child stays nourished.",

    "question": "What is the most challenging part about being a surrogate?",
    "answer": "LM: I think not being in total control is a little bit harder. Like this time I had dietary restrictions which is a little more difficult for me. Knowing I can’t just make a decision, it has to involve the parents, and the case manager, and the doctors. It’s not just something where you’re like “okay, I’ll do this.” For example, I wanted to fly out to Vegas to surprise my Dad for his birthday. So I had to get permission from the clinic, and my IM and my Case Manager. So it wasn’t just “hey, I’m gonna fly in and surprise you for lunch,” it was this big ordeal. It’s the lack of total control that can be a challenge. But ConceiveAbilities does a great job of making it really easy. Especially if there are harder questions, they can act as a mediator which is really nice.",
