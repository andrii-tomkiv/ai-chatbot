Can you recall a time when a nurse understood your needs even when you didn’t? We can. And, did you know that the pain of an infertility diagnosis is on par with the pain of being diagnosed with cancer, heart disease and other serious maladies? And that nurses are typically the first and most important resource attending to the emotional needs of these patients? We do. And we’re determined to help nurses in new ways. Read about our #EmpowerNursesChallenge. Do you know a nurse in your life that gives her heart to her patients? Empower nurses to take time for themselves! Nurses are the backbone of the healthcare system, playing a crucial role in patient care, advocacy, and emotional support. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, nursing is the nation’s largest healthcare profession, with nearly 4.7 million registered nurses (RNs) nationwide. Of all licensed registered nurses, 89% are employed in nursing. Nurses are the primary providers of hospital patient care and deliver most of the nation’s long-term medical care. Moreover, nurses are the single most trusted professional among a wide array, with 78% of us saying that they have high or very high levels of honesty and ethical standards. Nurses have held this distinction for over 20 years. The importance of nurses extends beyond clinical skills. Nurses give comfort and compassion to patients and families during some of the most vulnerable moments of their lives. This unwavering dedication often comes at a cost. Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. What is Compassion Fatigue According to The National Institutes of Health, compassion fatigue is defined as stress resulting from exposure to a traumatized individual. Professionals regularly exposed to the traumatic experiences of the people they service, such as healthcare, emergency and community service workers, are particularly susceptible to developing Compassion Fatigue. This can adversely impact the everyday lives of these individuals, as well as patient care and relationships with colleagues. It can lead to more serious mental health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. At ConceiveAbilities, in our efforts to support family-building through surrogacy and egg donation, we see and are particularly awed by the many fertility clinic nurses working with these families. At the same time, we know that the ongoing exposure to the lasting trauma of infertility creates substantial and real risks of compassion fatigue for these heroic nurses. Infertility is, indeed, a serious and traumatic condition. Nurses at our fertility clinic partners, as well as many of our surrogates who are also nurses, have experienced compassion fatigue but, at ConceiveAbilities, we believe that it does not have to be this way. Through our #EmpowerNursesChallenge, we are showing our appreciation to nurses by raising awareness about this problem and efforts to be resilient to it. As one gesture in a complex puzzle, we are thrilled to announce that we are donating 100 $100 gift cards to the nurses you know and love who join our challenge!

Resources to Combat Compassion Fatigue and Build Compassion Resilience Nurses are particularly vulnerable to compassion fatigue due to their everyday exposure to individuals that are experiencing trauma, including those that are suffering from infertility. Nurses also have the best insights about how to be resilient in the face of compassion fatigue. Through these videos, we want to assist nurses in sharing their best resiliency tips and strategies with one another. Here are some thought starters, based on five strategies to help nurses combat compassion fatigue: Implement Regular Self-Care Physical Health: Prioritize exercise, nutritious meals, and adequate sleep. Simple practices like staying hydrated and taking short breaks during shifts can make a big difference. Check out The Gym Nurse for workout split ideas and more health tips! Mental and Emotional Health: Engage in mindfulness, meditation, or breathing exercises. Take time for activities that bring joy and relaxation outside of work.

Here is Forbes list of Best Online Therapy Service of 2024. Foster Your relationships: Make time for lunch with a friend, date night with your significant other, and for your hobbies. Find your person who can be your sounding board to help you debrief from a hard day. Set and Maintain Boundaries Work-Life Separation: Develop clear boundaries between work and personal life to avoid carrying work-related stress home. Time Management: Learn to prioritize tasks and delegate when possible. Taking regular, scheduled breaks during shifts can also help manage stress. The American Nurses Association offers these Time Management Tips for Nurses. Foster Peer Support and Connection Support Groups: Join or form support groups with fellow nurses to share experiences and offer mutual support. Team Communication: Regular debriefings and open communication within the team can provide a sense of solidarity and shared understanding. Engage in Professional Development Continual Learning: Attend workshops, training sessions, and conferences focused on managing compassion fatigue and enhancing self-care techniques. Reflective Practice: Engage in reflective practices, such as journaling or discussing challenging cases with peers, to gain perspective and learn from experiences. Integrating these strategies can help nurses manage compassion fatigue more effectively, ensuring they maintain their well-being while providing high-quality care. What are your best tips?

    "content": "Share our #MilkDonationChallenge on social media and tag friends who are breastfeeding or pumping to donate breastmilk for money ConceiveAbilities, a surrogacy and egg donation agency dedicated to empowering women to find their giving journey, is once again launching a campaign to encourage lactating women to donate breastmilk for money and save infant lives. In two years, over 1 million individuals have helped to identify lactating women and make a lifesaving impact on infants in need of nourishment by promoting breast milk donation. The relaunch of the #MilkDonationChallenge recognizes the profound influence that a single act of generosity can have on those facing challenges. It aims to support lactating women who want to make a difference not only through their paid breast milk donations to help infants in need, but also inspiring other lactating women to join the giving journey. ConceiveAbilities’ Founder Nazca Fontes initiated the #MilkDonationChallenge to assist milk banks in replenishing their supply during the infant formula shortage. Since then, it continues as a significant movement. “Our vision to create a positive impact for families in need of nourishment has gained widespread attention, spreading rapidly across communities,” offers Fontes. “We are steadfastly dedicated to providing support for strong family foundations and for women who long to be part of these giving, growing and empowering communities.” The challenge runs until September 30, 2025. Do You Know a Lactating Woman? Here’s How to Join or Refer Them to Our the Paid Breast Milk Donation Challenge Everyone can play a role in the 2025 #MilkDonationChallenge and help us spread the word. Create a link and text, email and share that link on your social channels with potentially lactating women. Each person in your community who enters their information will learn more about how they can participate in the 2025 #MilkDonationChallenge. Second, donate breast milk to help families. Your breast milk donation can make a profound impact and every donor receives a $250 gift card for her time and effort.

Proof of donation must include: first and last name, phone number, date of donation, number of ounces donated, and the milk bank you donated to. It can be in the form of an email verification or donor portal photo. Not necessary, but an added bonus! Share a photo to help inspire other lactating moms to join the challenge (by sharing you agree ConceiveAbilities may use in our marketing including digital and social channels) Milk Donor Champion Stories Our Milk Donor Champions have made an incredible impact, contributing over 15% of the national milk bank supply.

Inspired by the giving nature of their surrogates, ConceiveAbilities Surrogacy and Egg Donor Agency launched the #MilkDonationChallenge in 2022, a movement to replenish milk bank supplies across the nation to help these families in need. The impacts of this shortage still persist. “In our work to help build families for more than twenty-five years, we know that many women find purpose in helping other families at a time of great need,” shared Founder Nazca Fontes, adding, “Like surrogacy, milk banks play a vital role in supporting families. We stand ready to assist all women who are able to help lift up other women, mothers, and families and help provide much needed nutrition to their babies. While there is – yet still – so much work to be done to address the infant formula shortage, we hope an increase of breast milk donations will be a lifeline for these families at this critical time.” Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services, adds, “Our surrogates are incredibly giving and often donate their breast milk after their surrogacy journey. By inspiring more women to donate, we hope those who are facing this uncertainty can rest easy at night knowing they can provide critical nutrition for their babies.” More Resources for Lactating Women: Do you need help finding lactation consultant services?

    "content": "Surrogacy, particularly social surrogacy, is often misunderstood. Many mistakenly believe Intended Mothers choose surrogacy for superficial reasons, like convenience or vanity, but these assumptions are far from reality. Social surrogacy decisions are often rooted in complex personal, professional, or health-related factors. Intended Parents may turn to surrogacy to safeguard their health, manage career demands, or ensure their family’s well-being. Judging these decisions without understanding their full context overlooks the deeply personal and sometimes difficult choices involved. Watch this video for a full explanation about Medical Surrogacy vs Social Surrogacy** What is the Difference Between Medical and Social Surrogacy? Surrogacy is commonly categorized into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While legal parentage considerations often drive this distinction, many Intended Parents mistakenly believe they can only pursue surrogacy for a “medical need.” But, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we strongly support all Intended Parents in their journey to grow their families, and appreciate a wide array of reasons for doing so — whether those reasons are medical in nature, or not. Surrogacy is typically classified into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While some assume surrogacy is only available for medical reasons, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we believe every Intended Parent deserves support in their efforts to build a family. Medical Need A clear medical need for surrogacy typically involves conditions that prevent Intended Parents from carrying a pregnancy to term. This includes scenarios such as: Diagnosed infertility Male same-sex couples Women without a uterus Individuals with life-threatening illnesses Additionally, specific fertility diagnoses, histories of cancer, necessary medication that is incompatible with pregnancy, and more may also qualify as medical needs. In addition, we have seen some mental health diagnoses rising to the medical need threshold. The “strength” of an Intended Parent’s medical need may impact which states they can match with a surrogate, as surrogacy laws vary across jurisdictions. The bottom line for a medical need is that a doctor (be it a reproductive endocrinologist or other appropriate specialist) has made a medical opinion and determination that the Intended Parents have a medical need to pursue surrogacy. The legal community typically will look for such a decision to be made in writing. Social Surrogacy On the other hand, anything that is not a “clear medical need” falls under the social surrogacy category. Unfortunately, this option often carries a stigma, with critics assuming the Intended Mother simply wants to avoid the physical aspects of pregnancy for reasons of vanity, convenience, or wanting to shift the risks to someone else. In practice, however, that is rarely true. The vast majority of individuals seeking parenthood through the path of surrogacy for reasons other than a “clear medical need” have a reasonable and valid need for surrogacy based on meaningful life circumstances. Here are some common examples of reasonable necessity: Professional Athletes: Athletes like professional ballerinas may have limited career windows where peak physical performance is critical. Her physical appearance and athleticism are critical components of her livelihood and opportunity for success. If she were to take time off to have a child, she risks her career. Surrogacy allows professional athletes a viable and crucial path to growing their family. Unexplained Infertility: In cases where a doctor cannot determine why a couple or person is unable to conceive and is uncomfortable making a medical determination that they cannot carry a pregnancy, some opt for surrogacy to ensure the best chance of having a child. High Risk Careers: Individuals in high-risk professions, such as pilots or construction workers, often face demanding physical challenges and potential hazards on the job. Choosing surrogacy allows them to protect their health and well-being, while also safeguarding their baby’s development. For a pilot, long hours, high altitudes, and fluctuating cabin pressure could pose serious risks during pregnancy. Similarly, construction workers may encounter dangerous environments that could jeopardize both the mother and baby. Surrogacy offers these professionals peace of mind, enabling them to continue their livelihoods without compromising the safety of their family. Familial Health Concerns: Intended Mothers with a strong family history of serious health conditions, like breast cancer, may choose surrogacy to avoid potential risks tied to pregnancy hormones. Challenging Recovery: Some Intended Mothers have a medical condition that does not inherently preclude her from carrying, but would make recovery from delivery an especially arduous, lengthy process. Surrogacy allows them to focus on their health and be present for their newborn child. Our Commitment to Building Families At ConceiveAbilities, we recognize that every family’s surrogacy journey is unique. Our focus is on understanding the why behind each decision– whatever that may be – ensuring that both the Intended Parents and surrogates feel fully informed and comfortable. Through our Matching Matters™ process, we work closely with surrogates to ensure they’re aware of the Intended Parents’ reasons for choosing surrogacy, whether it’s medical, not medical, or a combination of factors. “The key is transparency,” says Fran Caruso, Esq. “We help surrogates and Intended Parents build relationships based on trust and mutual understanding.” Ultimately, we are proud to support Intended Parents from all walks of life. We have deep regard and appreciation for the fact that there are a wide array of important reasons for why people pursue surrogacy. Begin your surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities today. We are honored to assist you in growing your family.",

    "content": "Managing surrogacy-related medical expenses can be complex, time-consuming, and overwhelming, and insurance companies often complicate the process. As your full service surrogacy agency, it is our job to guide and protect you through every step of the surrogacy process.

Common Surrogacy Medical Coverage Questions What is the cost of my surrogate’s medical coverage? The direct medical coverage for your surrogate is fully included in our All-In Program.

Any surrogacy pregnancy related costs that her insurance does not cover will be handled through our All-In Program’s direct medical coverage, which eliminates common exclusions found in standard policies. Can my health insurance cover surrogacy-related costs? No, your insurance will not cover medical expenses for the gestational carrier since she is not a member of your policy. However, once the baby is born, your insurance may apply to the baby’s medical care.

    "content": "Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. ConceiveAbilities spoke with Clinical Nurse Liaison, Kristina Fabis, APRN, FNP-BC, RNC-OB. Kristina was a labor and delivery nurse with over 23 years of experience before joining the ConceiveAbilities team. Kristina has been a surrogate three times with ConceiveAbilities, “Being a nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a surrogate has brought fulfillment and purpose to my life. It has allowed me to care for others in their time of need.” Read below to learn more about compassion fatigue and how Kristina recommends nurses take care of themselves. How have you experienced compassion fatigue in your nursing career?I’ve experienced compassion fatigue a few different ways and times throughout my nursing career. The majority of my career was spent in a busy Labor and Delivery unit that was frequently understaffed. Not only did I work full time but I was often required to work ‘on-call.’ I was at the hospital so much, both during the day and back overnight. It slowly led to exhaustion. While I would never let it affect how I treated or cared for my patients, my identity was slowly slipping away. I was beginning to forget who I was outside of the hospital; as a mom, wife, friend, daughter, you name it. I began to feel like I was ‘going through the motions.’ I was a robot who could only do one thing: care for others and never for herself. Over the years, we observed a notable increase in the severity of our patients’ conditions which often affected their post delivery recovery, even leading to emergency situations. That resulted in extremely stressful work environments. I began to experience burnout. What are ways you decompress, relax, and recharge when experiencing compassion fatigue?I really utilize my vacation time. I rely on my friends and family. I encourage others to speak up about their struggles and their experiences. Put the chore or household task aside and spend 15, 30, or 60 minutes doing something you love which brings you joy. I plan activities outside of the hospital and home to help me decompress. This includes spending time at the lake, training for a 5k, or even a quick girls weekend. What communities have helped you navigate the highs and lows of your nursing career?Undoubtedly, my work family was the #1 community that helped me to navigate the highs and lows of my nursing career. My co-workers and colleagues became my second family, especially considering how much time we spent around each other each week. More than anyone, they knew how I felt and the challenges we faced as nurses. When a hospital’s administration or our department manager left us understaffed and with limited resources, it was my fellow nurses that I leaned on and vice versa. Together we got through countless emergent and stressful situations. What advice do you have for other nurses struggling with compassion fatigue? Put Yourself First: Make yourself a priority. Develop new interests outside of medicine and your profession. Take Care of Your Health: Your health, including what you put into your body, how frequently you exercise and how long you rest, is important. Take a walk, even if only for 10 minutes; those additional steps do have an impact. Commit to a healthier diet. No change is too small. Have Something to Anticipate: Always have something that you are looking forward to. Leverage Available Support Networks: Look into your employer’s EAP (Employee Assistance Program) plan. Mental health is important. There are even numerous virtual platforms, such as BetterHelp, these days which make therapy and counseling possible from the confines of your own home. Ensure You Get Enough Sleep: Finally, don’t deprive yourself of sleep or underestimate its importance. How do you combat compassion fatigue as a nurse?

    "content": "Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. ConceiveAbilities met with Kelly Rayburn, a registered nurse with over 27 years experience, to talk about her work with compassion fatigue. While receiving her Masters in Nursing, Kelly dedicated her research towards compassion fatigue. Below are her insights and answers to some commonly asked questions surrounding compassion fatigue. Tell us about your academic work with compassion fatigue.My research project when I was getting my Masters in Nursing was on Compassion Fatigue. Two group members and I were all experienced Labor & Delivery nurses and had only heard the topic in relation to other nursing specialities. We decided to see if L&D nurses were also at risk for compassion fatigue. After an extensive literature review, we were not finding much information on compassion fatigue in our area of nursing. We created our own research study. The end result? Yes, L&D nurses are at risk for compassion fatigue. When people hear that I used to work as a nurse in L&D, they say, “Oh that must be so fun!” or “It must be so cool to hold babies all day.” Yes, it was fun. No, we do not hold babies all day. When things were good, it left one with a sense of pride and accomplishment. When terrible events occurred, however, which they unfortunately did, it left a traumatic mark on all involved. Our study identified L&D nurses were at risk for compassion fatigue and then focused on ways to combat it. Nurses are always supporting and caring for others, but who supports the nurse caring for others? How have you experienced compassion fatigue in your nursing career?For me, there wasn’t one clear event that led to compassion fatigue. An unresolved traumatic event, running a support group for bereaved mothers when you are grieving yourself, days of being in charge and making decisions for the unit, and being short staffed and working beyond your capabilities with no break all led to compassion fatigue. My first insights into compassion fatigue surfaced when I realized that when I got home from work, I had nothing left to give my family. I felt empty, unable to make the simplest of decisions, unable to enjoy their company, so exhausted that I just wanted to sleep, and lying in bed not able to sleep as the days replayed themselves. My personality was changing. I would sit in my car every morning wondering if I really did need to go inside the building, pray that “nothing bad would happen today on my watch,” and feel just an overwhelming sense of anxiety entering the hospital. When my job became more about charting defensively “in case” something happened, and less about providing the nurturing competent care that I should have been focused on, I knew it was time to leave the bedside. I no longer felt the joy that each delivery brought; I no longer felt I cared enough, did enough, or was enough. What are ways you decompress, relax, and recharge when experiencing compassion fatigue?My family is the most important thing in the world to me. When I left the bedside, I wanted to make sure it was to do something that would allow me more time with them. I decompress by spending time with my grandkids, playing with them, laughing with them, and snuggling them. I’ve learned all too well that you don’t get that time back. They recharge my sense of balance in this world. When I was in the deepest hole of compassion fatigue and depression, I sought solace and advice from friends. True friends that are there for the thick of it, including my bedside nursing friends who understood the fears and anxiety and my teaching friends who offered support when the pandemic hit and we all scrambled to find a new way of educating future nursing students. For me, talking relieved some of the burnout. When I was too tired to talk, I used other avenues of comfort, including listening to Christian music, reading, riding my bike, hiking in the woods, and crafting. Twice a year I go with friends to a weekend scrapbook retreat. There I can create memory books, reminisce about pictures, share stories, and just laugh with no other agenda. It is my “me time.” What communities have helped you navigate the highs and lows of your nursing career?Absolutely my faith. I pray to a higher being and trust that He is always looking out for me; my faith has been instrumental in my ability to survive compassion fatigue. While I do not get to service often, I listen to uplifting Christian music that “speaks” my story; these songs inspire me to be a better person and to have faith even when things seem impossible. My friends have also helped me navigate the highs and lows of my career. Their support, encouragement, advice, and time together helped me maneuver so much these past 30 years. My hobbies are an escape from my career; a time for me to be something other than a nurse, an educator and a manager. Immersion in my hobbies is one time I can just be me. What resources, products, and suggestions can you provide for other nurses struggling with compassion fatigue?When we started our research project, we were looking specifically at Labor and Delivery, Postpartum, and NICU nurses. We understand now, especially in light of the pandemic, that no specific specialty is immune to compassion fatigue. It isn’t even exclusive to nursing. Anyone who provides care for someone else who has pain, suffering, and mental anguish can experience compassion fatigue. My suggestions are: Find someone that you can trust and confide in. Seek a friend or a counselor who has experience with compassion fatigue. Journal your feelings and experiences. Explore what it is that you need to do in order to get healthy. We can’t care for others when we cannot care for ourselves. Is it time away, time off, time with people, time alone? Think about what makes you happy and do more of it! Even if it’s scheduling a few minutes a day to start and working up from there. I wouldn’t be a nurse if I didn’t throw this in here: proper sleep, exercise and nutrition. Again, start slow. A walk around the house, the block, the neighborhood. Reconnect with nature. Have a hobby that you have always wanted to try? Do it! A hobby sitting unfinished? Start it back up again. Finally, accept that it is ok to NOT be ok. As nurses we are accustomed to giving care, not accepting it. We advocate for our patients, but not often enough for ourselves. Understand that compassion fatigue and everything that comes with it is normal. The ability to recognize it and treat it allows us to survive it.

    "content": "Support Guide for the Military Wife Only those who experience it firsthand truly understand the unique demands of military wife life. And these challenges are faced not only by the service members on assignment but the family members who support them. Building your family with flexibility and care is key as you consider life in the service. At ConceiveAbilities, we support a number of military families as they pursue surrogacy, which is why we have put together this dedicated support guide tailored to help families navigate military life. Understanding Military Life with Family There are a handful of challenges you may face as a military wife, and even more if you have kids to parent. Fortunately, there are many other wives and moms who understand and have been through, or are currently going through, similar obstacles. Some of these challenges include: Parenting alone during spouse’s deployment Relocating to a new base across the country Finding community and support where you live Knowing how to utilize healthcare services for pregnancy, childbirth, maternity, and pediatric care Choosing a suitable career that is flexible with the military lifestyle Below, we’ll address common questions related to these challenges and offer some tips from other military wives and moms who have learned through their experiences how to adapt and thrive in the midst of the demands of military wife life. Common Military Questions & Answers About Being a Military Wife Deployment and Parenting How do I parent alone during my spouse’s military deployment? Parenting solo isn’t easy, but by following some helpful, tried-and-true tips from other military wives, you can do it! A Mother Far From Home recommends: Embracing community for yourself and your kids Hiring a babysitter so you can run errands, spend time with friends, and relax Asking family to come for a visit to offer a helping hand Celebrating the little things, like making it to the next month as a kind of countdown until your spouse returns Establishing a routine for your kids. Their lives may change a lot, but their day-to-day routines can remain somewhat consistent Communicating with your spouse whenever possible; and when you aren’t on a call, talk about them with your kids Prioritizing your mental health by keeping your mind in the present and seeking help when you need it What are some ways I can help my child cope with a parent’s deployment? First, know there are military and family life counseling programs available to you and your children. Don’t be afraid to utilize these resources and support during this time. A few other things that could help include: Letting them voice what they’re feeling to you; listen with an open mind so they know they’re heard Allowing them to get involved in clubs, sports, or other community activities as a healthy distraction throughout the week Keeping a consistent routine to their day Maintaining long-distance contact with parent whenever possible Planning activities like making homecoming signs, special countdowns, or crafting memory scrapbooks How can we maintain a strong family bond when my spouse is deployed? Maintaining a strong long-distance relationship as a couple and a family can be difficult, but the biggest help is openly communicating one another’s expectations and making a plan ahead of time. Some expectations to discuss include: How do you plan to keep in touch (phone, texts, social media, Facetime, zoom, email, letters)? What methods of communication would be most helpful for each person to feel emotionally connected to the other (care packages, singing songs together, sending videos or pictures, starting a journal to record and share special memories and moments)? Consider asking other military spouses you know what worked best for their family for more ideas.Relocations and Transitions How can I help my child adjust to new schools and make friends quickly after military relocation? One of the best ways to help your child adjust to their new school is by getting involved. The first person you can contact is the school liaison officer who focuses on helping students with school transitions. Next, consider joining the PTA or getting involved in the school Facebook group to look for ways you can volunteer at the school. This is a great way to get to know other parents and help your kids get connected with new friends. What resources are available to help us understand each new location better for an easier transition? Similar to most new moves, one of the best things you can do to get to know a new city is to get out and explore. Try out coffee shops and local restaurants to find places you might want to frequent while you’re there. You can also get on social media and get connected with local groups to discover events happening near you or find common interest groups you might want to join. If your kids start joining sports clubs or teams, that’s another great way to fill your time and get to know local residents who can give you recommendations for things to do and see. How do I maintain my own career with frequent moves due to my spouse’s military transitions? If you’re already established in a job you enjoy, consider asking your boss if you can stay on and work remotely. While that may seem like a big ask, and your ability to do so will depend on the job, you don’t have much to lose. Not to mention, with the rise in remote work, it’s entirely possible they will be willing to work with you. At the very least, it shows your level of care for the organization or company and desire to stay on with them, which could open up future opportunities to come back and work for them when your spouse’s assignment is done or if you happen to relocate back to the area. When remote work is not an option, consider searching for a future job in your profession that has your needed flexibility. Community and Support Where can I connect with other military spouses who understand what I’m going through? Aside from getting to know other families your spouse works with, locally stationed at the same base, there are groups you can join, from military spouse groups listed on MeetUp and Facebook to programs like the Military Spouse Advocacy Network. Any of these groups would be helpful to connect with so you can combat common feelings of loneliness as a military spouse. How do I stay connected with friends and family who are far away? There are many tools at our disposal today to help us stay connected with friends and family when you live far away. Some of these include tools like Facetime, Zoom, texting, mailing letters and care packages, WhatsApp, Marco Polo, SnapChat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and GroupMe. Just be mindful of safe social posting practices when your spouse is active in the military for your safety and theirs. Where can I find information about local community events and activities for military families to get involved in quickly? One of the best ways to find this information is through local Facebook groups, newspaper or news station event announcements, or searching on Google for a list of activities near you. Accessing Healthcare Services How does our family access healthcare services after relocating? There are a few options for families when looking for a provider that accepts a TRICARE plan. The first is visiting the military treatment facility (MTF) on base. This will be the easiest method of seeking care, but it’s not the only one. The other option is to search for a military hospital or clinic, network provider, or non-network provider using the TRICARE website. What are TRICARE’s coverage options for maternity care and pediatric visits? TRICARE has an extensive list of medical services that are covered in relation to conception and delivery, including prenatal care, post-partum care (generally 6 weeks after delivery), and treatment of any complications. Discover a more comprehensive list of services on the TRICARE website as well as your plan options. For pediatric visits, TRICARE says it covers office visits, immunizations, and vision screenings from birth to age 6 at no cost, regardless of plan selection. Learn more about their pediatric healthcare services on their website. What mental health services are available through TRICARE? Is this available for spouses and children? There are a number of mental health therapeutic services available for military personnel, as well as their spouse and children. For a full list of services, visit the TRICARE website here. Flexible Career Options What are the best career fields for military spouses? The best career opportunities for military spouses are going to be jobs that allow for remote and flexible work. This is ideal when needing to relocate and for managing more at home during your spouse’s deployment. How can I continue my education or professional training online? If you’re in school finishing your degree, or taking classes to further your career, speak with the professor or school about continuing your education online or transferring your current course credits to an online educational institution. Are there specific employment programs to help military wives find jobs? There are services available like Hire Heroes USA that helps you prepare for and find a flexible job as a military spouse, or even for veterans when your spouse finishes their duty. Stories of Resilience and Success Growing up as a military brat and eight years as a military spouse, ConceiveAbilities surrogate and employee, Tayler Lewis has a deep passion for both the military community and surrogacy. In a heartfelt conversation on our podcast, “All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes,” Tayler shares, “As a military spouse, we tend to resonate with words like “calling” and “purpose.” We may not serve in the same capacity as our active duty partners, but we strive to make a difference. That can look like volunteering, engaging in our community, and supporting others as they navigate the challenges of military life. We are also on a mission. We truly believe that we are fulfilling an important purpose. Military spouses are known for their resourcefulness, for creating strategies, and for executing plans. Surrogacy provides us with a similar sense of calling.” Listen to Tayler’s full podcast A Calling to Serve: An Interview with Military Spouse Tayler Lewis on Becoming a Surrogate. Read more stories from military spouseswho found their calling through surrogacy. How Surrogacy Fits into the Military Family Lifestyle Surrogacy is a process in which a woman carries a child who is not genetically related to her for someone else. The motive behind surrogacy—helping someone in the community who can’t have a child of their own—aligns well with the military family lifestyle in desiring to serve others. It offers significant financial compensation while providing the flexibility military families need to be present with their own family and do something that can be accomplished in the midst of frequent relocations.“I wanted to become a surrogate for as long as I can remember. After having two easy pregnancies, I felt it was time to share my super amazing ability as a woman to help a deserving family. At the time, my husband was stationed in Illinois on Recruiting Duty for the Marine Corps, so I took the opportunity to pursue my dream; he was supportive from the very beginning! Knowing that I could help create or grow a family was the most amazing feeling in the world.After a successful delivery of a baby girl, my heart was full and I knew my life had changed forever. I decided that surrogacy was something I was extremely passionate about, so I decided to pursue it in my career as well. Now, I work here at ConceiveAbilities as a Surrogate Engagement Coordinator, helping potential surrogates get started on their own surrogacy journeys. I can’t imagine a job more fulfilling and I am still able to help grow families every day.” Ashley Wilson, Experienced Surrogate, Mom of 2, Marine Wife Learn More About Surrogacy as a Military Wife",

    "content": "How to Ship Frozen Breast Milk Can you ship breast milk? Yes! Whether you are a new mother who is breastfeeding or you are a lactating surrogate who is preparing to ship breast milk to intended parents, you may be wondering how to ship breast milk. Working moms traveling for business may also find it beneficial to ship their milk home. No matter your reasons for wanting to ship breast milk, our team can help. We put together a comprehensive guide on how to mail breast milk effectively and safely, including some important do’s and don’ts on mailing breast milk, ensuring your milk arrives in the best condition while you focus on how to maintain and increase milk supply. Steps to Shipping Breast Milk First, select an insulated shipping container. You can search on platforms like Amazon for a container that is leakproof and structurally sound for transport. Collect your breast milk. First, label durable, BPA-free bags, bottles, or pouches with the date. Then, use a breast pump to fill them with milk, remove the excess air, and seal them. Be prepared to freeze them as soon as you finish this step.Pro Tip: As you’re filling your bags/bottles/pouches, leave some room in them; the milk will expand when frozen. Otherwise, they will burst. Once the milk is frozen, pack the breast milk in your insulated box as tightly as possible. The milk should go into the box first, then the other items to cool and insulate it. Shipping a smaller amount of milk? You can nestle it between layers of ice packs.Pro Tip: If the milk doesn’t fill the box, you’ll want to strategically load up the rest of the box. Add in packing material such as newspaper and then put the frozen gel packs or ice packs on top, cover it with a plastic bag, and then seal it in the box. Want even more peace of mind? Include a temperature monitoring device within your shipment, which can ensure the milk maintains a safe temperature. Finish packaging the shipment by taping it up with duct tape and labeling it. Label requirements may differ across courier services, so inquire about additional information if needed. There are additional methods for packing up your breast milk. For instance, you can use thick-walled Styrofoam coolers and cardboard boxes. Simply store your breast milk storage bags in the cooler and place them in the cardboard box or shipping box. Make sure to choose a cooler that is not too large but is large enough for the ice packs, insulation material, and breast milk. Watch our How To Pump, Ship and Donate Breast Milk Surrogacy Tutorial with Lactation Expert Lenna Gregory Do’s and Don’ts of Shipping Breast Milk Do: Use an insulated box. It needs to be sturdy, as well as able to withstand freezing and thawing. Pack tightly. You want to preserve the milk and prevent it from moving too much in transit. Label the package properly. As you’re writing your labels, indicate that the shipment includes frozen breast milk that is perishable. Breast milk is considered “liquid gold“ and must be treated as such! Ship overnight, as you want the breast milk to stay frozen in transit. DHL, FedEx, UPS, and USPS offer milk shipping services, so you can rest assured your shipment will maintain its temperature and be delivered quickly. You can also check out specialized organizations like Milk Stork that take care of shipping for you. Consider timing when shipping your breast milk. You will want to avoid shipping later in the week; weekend deliveries generally cost more, and on Sundays, there is no delivery service. Earlier in the week, such as on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, you are less likely to face delays. Update the recipient on shipping details. By providing the recipient with relevant tracking information, you can prepare them to accept your shipment and store the milk right away. Don’t: Freeze breast milk without removing air first. This can result in freezer burn. Use dry ice. It doesn’t melt, but rather, goes through sublimation. In other words, the dry ice changes from a solid to a gas. Because of this, pressure could build up in your package, and it could even explode in transit. Ship 2-day. Do not use 2-day services or ground service to ship milk. It will thaw. Because breast milk is perishable, it must be transported swiftly in a temperature-controlled environment. Make sure milk is being shipped by an overnight service that is guaranteed. Pack loosely. The contents of your package need to be snug. Bubble wrap, crumbled newspaper, and foam peanuts can be used for padding. If you need an alternative, you can purchase shipping kits from companies like Save the Milk. Pack and ship breast milk without researching local laws in your location and the recipient’s location. This is extremely important if you plan to ship breast milk internationally. Though it’s legal (and relatively straightforward) to ship breast milk within the United States, you may have to abide by additional requirements based on that specific country’s regulations.On a similar note, if you’re donating breast milk to a milk bank or hospital (especially the NICU), you will likely need to follow specific instructions from them as well. Handling Breast Milk Upon Delivery As long as milk is over 50% frozen when it arrives, it can be put into the freezer and be safe to feed to babies. Families receiving the milk should open the package and inspect the milk to make sure everything is frozen and in good condition. Then, they should freeze it immediately and use it within 6 months (if stored in the refrigerator freezer) or 12 months (if stored in the deep freezer). Of course, breast milk shipping experiences between women will be different. For example, service providers’ pricing—and how they determine shipping costs based on distance to the destination, package weight, and other factors—will vary. But, with careful planning, shipping frozen breast milk can be a smooth and rewarding experience, leaving you to concentrate on maintaining and increasing your milk supply. Looking for more guidance?

    "content": "At ConceiveAbilities, we have the honor of working alongside military spouses, every day, who dedicate themselves to serving others. Meet four of our military spouses: Tayler, Vanessa, Laci, and Ash. These ConceiveAbilities employees have supported their military spouses’ call to serve. Now, they are answering their own call to serve, by helping build families through surrogacy. This Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we celebrate these ConceiveAbilities employees who have served their communities in more ways than one. Read more about these incredible women below! Pictured: Ash and her husband Please tell us a bit about yourself: Tayler: My name is Tayler and I am a Surrogate Advisor at ConceiveAbilities. I have two beautiful children of my own and I proudly delivered a surrogate baby in 2022. In this season of my life, I am still discovering who I am beyond my roles as a spouse and mother. I’m a licensed skydiver, a former veterinary technician with a decade of experience, an avid adventure seeker, and, at my very core, I am an empath. My empathetic nature gives me a deep understanding of the emotions and experiences of others, which drives my desire to support and uplift those around me. Vanessa: My name is Vanessa. My husband and I have three amazing kids: Bradley (9), Arlyn (7), and Adler (2). As a family, we love to stay active by skiing or hiking as much as we can here in beautiful Colorado Springs, our favorite duty station. Ever since the birth of my first child, I have had a strong passion for birth. I quickly became a childbirth educator and doula to help serve other expecting moms in the cities we were stationed. Ultimately, my love for pregnancy and birth led me to pursue a surrogacy journey which I just completed in October 2023. Now, I have the joy of helping other women begin their surrogacy journeys as a Surrogate Advisor at ConceiveAbilities. Laci: My name is Laci Compton. I have been a surrogate through ConceiveAbilities and now work as a Surrogate Advisor! I live in New York State with my husband and our two daughters Lila and Holland! We have a small zoo with two cats, one dog, and a hamster and we are looking to add chickens this year. We are Montana natives but our heart is in Alaska and we cannot wait to get back there someday when my husband retires. Ash: My name is Ash Golike! I’m originally from California but I have lived in the Southeast for 8 years. We recently PCS’d (Permanent Change of Station) to Fort Campbell and live in Tennessee. My husband and I are high school sweethearts, and together we have two kiddos, Izzy (8) and Isaac (3). As a family we enjoy kayaking, hiking, exploring new places or simply snuggling up on the couch to read a good book or watch a fun movie. I work as a Health Information Specialist at ConceiveAbilities. What branch of service is your spouse in? Tayler: My husband, Mason, was a sergeant and served in the United States Army as a firearms instructor and a cargo specialist. He served for 8 years. Vanessa: My husband Mike is in the Air Force. We are almost to the 20 year mark! Looking forward to retirement, and hoping to never move again. Laci: My husband is a Warrant Officer in the Army and he works as a Blackhawk Pilot. Ash: My husband is in the Army. He started out as a combat engineer but just recently became a Medevac Helicopter Pilot. Pictured: Tayler and her husband, Mason Did being a military spouse influence your decision to help build families by becoming a surrogate? Tayler: Being a military spouse had a significant impact on my decision to help build families through ConceiveAbilities, in addition to my own personal reasons for embarking on such a journey). I conducted extensive research and followed other military spouses sharing their experiences. ConceiveAbilities was full of selfless women on a mission to build families and also offered the most incredible support system I could have asked for. These women understood the journey both as mothers and military spouses, providing a sense of camaraderie and encouragement that made all the difference. Vanessa: Being a military spouse, it’s in our DNA to serve and help others. I have met so many amazing families over the years and the struggle of infertility has always been on my heart. I wanted a way to tangibly help. Laci: Absolutely! Military spouses tend to stand in the shadow of their soldiers. I wanted something of my own and to give back in any way I could. I now work for ConceiveAbilities since my journey gave me so much joy and I knew I wanted to turn that into a career. As a full-time employee, I have taken this job with me to four states as we moved for my husband’s career. Ash: I have not been a surrogate, but I am honored to work with surrogates every day. As a military spouse, my husband’s career and our life together has always centered around putting others first. It’s a sacrifice we have both made in our own roles as a service member and a spouse. Because of this, I’ve always gravitated towards wanting to help others and making a positive impact wherever I go. The most magical moment in my life is when I became a mom. Although each journey to parenthood is unique, there is no beauty that shines brighter than that of a surrogate with a good heart willing to make dreams come true. Pictured: Laci and family How has your experience as a surrogate changed your life? Tayler: From 2021 to 2022, I was a surrogate with ConceiveAbilities. This was an experience I had discussed with my husband since giving birth to our last child. As a military spouse, I resonate with words like “serve,” “calling,” and “purpose.” We may not serve in the same capacity as our active-duty partners but we strive to make a difference. This can involve volunteering, engaging in our community, or supporting others as they navigate the challenges of military life. When we take action, we truly believe we are fulfilling an important purpose. When you blend that sense of mission with the desire to help others through surrogacy, it brings about a profound and loving fulfillment, providing a genuine sense of life-changing purpose. It was empowering to know that I could “serve” in my own way: I could financially contribute to our family and, no matter where the Army sent us, I could pick up those roots and plant them where we were called next. Vanessa: Surrogacy has always been on my heart after a fellow military spouse needed the help of a gestational carrier. We were stationed back to back in non-surrogacy friendly states, but finally landed in Colorado where I was able to pursue a journey after the birth of our third baby. Laci: Surrogacy was the most rewarding experience of my life. At the time, I had just decided to stop working to be home full-time with our two-year-old. I knew I always wanted to explore surrogacy because I wanted to share the gift of maintaining a healthy pregnancy that came to me so easily. I knew others struggled but what I did not expect was the immense sense of purpose it gave me. I felt like I was not only contributing to my family financially but I belonged to something so much greater than myself that we all took part in! Pictured: Vanessa and her Intended Parents How has your work and/or experience with ConceiveAbilities help you serve others? Tayler: Helping build families as a military spouse, surrogate, and employee with ConceiveAbilities has been a deeply personal way for me to serve others. I often meet applicants who share the lifestyle I experienced for 28 years and I have the privilege of guiding them through the screening process as one of the first people they connect with on their journeys. Beyond my professional role, I aim to be a true friend to these women. I offer advice and support with a sense of empathy and understanding, as someone who has walked a similar path. Vanessa: Being able to help another family grow was such a joy! I’m excited to help other families through my role with ConceiveAbilities. Laci: We now consider our former “Intended Parents” family. We are unbelievably close and get to go through life together celebrating this boy we brought into the world. This has impacted me greatly and is the most rewarding experience of my life. Being a surrogate was my way to serve and being an employee with ConceiveAbilities is how I continue to serve. Every day I get to help build families; what is better than that? Ash: ConceiveAbilities is so special to me because it allows me to serve families who might be in need and to invest in surrogates who are passionately wanting to be the light for others. Inspired by our military spouses? If you are a military spouse and are called to become a surrogate, we have resources for you, including other military spouses who you can connect with.

    "content": "Nurse Appreciation Week is the perfect time to shine a spotlight on the unsung heroes of healthcare: nurses who tirelessly devote themselves to helping build families. At ConceiveAbilities, we are proud to have fifteen amazing nurses on our team who dedicate themselves to guiding our surrogates and families through the surrogacy process. It is our privilege to take a moment to recognize the remarkable contributions of each of our nurses on staff who go above and beyond each day to make a difference. We highlight here just four of our very special ConceiveAbilities nurses who bring their expertise to helping build families: Kelly, Erica, Kristina, and Nicole, experienced nurses with a combined 75 years of nursing experience and two of whom were surrogates themselves!! Why did you answer the call to become a nurse? Kelly: I was actually a pre-med student and getting ready to take my MCATs. A short hospital stay and having an incredible nurse care for me started turning my wheels and I began to ask myself what exactly I wanted to do in healthcare. A short time later I transferred into the nursing program and have been a nurse now for thirty two years. Erica: My mom works in the medical field and growing up I would sometimes go with her to her patient’s house. I found that I have always enjoyed helping others and when I had my children, I knew that Obstetrics was where I was supposed to be. I have now been a nurse for six years. I knew that God wanted me to be the support person for women and families experiencing the joy and heartbreak of labor and delivery. Kristina: I have had the honor of being a nurse for eighteen years and a nurse practitioner for five years. Prior to becoming a nurse, I had worked for an insurance company processing health and dental claims and then for two additional companies in health information technology. While I enjoyed my work, I felt a strong pull to become a nurse, to give of myself and to make a difference in someone’s life. Nicole: Growing up the oldest in my family, I was always looking out and taking care of my younger brothers. I have always shown compassion and empathy and enjoy helping others. Becoming a nurse fourteen years ago was the perfect extension of that. How has being a nurse impacted your life for the better? Kelly: Being a nurse has given me so many amazing opportunities for growth, allowed me to do something I love while still being home and available for my kids (including many many years on nights), fueled my inquisitive mind for medical research, and gave me the tools to teach other aspiring nurses. Erica: Nursing has brought many wonderful people into my life. Friendships in the nursing world are founded on a bond of trust and mutual commitment to improving human life and I am eternally grateful for the relationships I have made in my career. Kristina: Being a nurse and a nurse practitioner has brought fulfillment and purpose to my life. It allows me to care for others in their time of need and to promote health and wellbeing. Nicole: I have been able to experience the joys of becoming parents with my patients and made so many amazing connections with people throughout my nursing career. How did being a nurse impact your decision to become a surrogate and how did it change your life? Erica: My passion for nursing played a significant role in leading me to become a surrogate. Assisting families has always brought me immense joy, and I believe that surrogacy is the ultimate way to make a positive impact on creating families. In labor and delivery, I have seen many people struggle to have a child and the joy they experience when that finally happens is beyond words. I knew early on that I wanted to be able to help another family experience that joy. I knew I wanted to take an active role in helping someone achieve their dream of growing their family. Surrogacy was the answer for me! There is no greater joy than being a part of this process. The extended families that I have formed though the process of surrogacy are ones that I will cherish forever. Kristina: I am a three-time surrogate, having carried a total of five babies for three different couples. As a labor and delivery nurse, I had a deep knowledge of the pregnancy process and I knew that I would have the support not only of my friends and family but from my nurse colleagues…..and my obstetricians whom I worked alongside everyday at the hospital. I’ve always felt a pull or calling towards obstetrics and truly been enamored by the miracle of life. Creating my family had been relatively easy and I was more than aware that for many that is not the case. I had been raised to give back, to volunteer, to ‘do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.’ I felt that if I could do something like this for someone else, why wouldn’t I? Would I have wanted someone to do the same for me if the situation was reversed? How has your nursing background expanded your capacity to care for others while working with ConceiveAbilities? Kelly: As a nurse at ConceiveAbilities, I am helping to ensure our surrogates have been medically screened and can safely move forward in the process. Ensuring safety, building trust, showing empathy, and rejoicing when the goal is met (sounds like a nurse caring for a patient, right?) are all actions of caring. And each of these actions are stepping stones that create a path for helping to build families. Erica: Nursing and surrogacy have allowed me to fulfill my calling of helping build families whether it’s through support in labor and delivery or the postpartum period or being entrusted to carry someone’s precious gift as a surrogate. Kristina: I like to think that as a surrogate I was able to lighten the load of worries for each of my three sets of intended parents. It enabled me to bring happiness into their lives. As an employee of ConceiveAbilities these past 12 years, I’ve been able to care for surrogates through the education and support I have provided throughout their application process. Nicole: As a ConceiveAbilities employee, I know that we are all working together to care for our surrogates and intended parents as they go through one of life’s biggest moments. Happy Nurse Appreciation Week to all nurses, and especially to Kelly, Erica, Kristina, Nicole, and all of our nurses on the ConceiveAbilities staff! Inspired by our nurses?

Whether you are a new mother who is breastfeeding or you are a lactating surrogate who is preparing to ship breast milk to intended parents, you may be wondering how to ship breast milk. Working moms traveling for business may also find it beneficial to ship their milk home. No matter your reasons for wanting to ship breast milk, our team can help. We put together a comprehensive guide on how to mail breast milk effectively and safely, including some important do’s and don’ts on mailing breast milk, ensuring your milk arrives in the best condition while you focus on how to maintain and increase milk supply. Steps to Shipping Breast Milk First, select an insulated shipping container. You can search on platforms like Amazon for a container that is leakproof and structurally sound for transport. Collect your breast milk. First, label durable, BPA-free bags, bottles, or pouches with the date. Then, use a breast pump to fill them with milk, remove the excess air, and seal them. Be prepared to freeze them as soon as you finish this step.Pro Tip: As you’re filling your bags/bottles/pouches, leave some room in them; the milk will expand when frozen. Otherwise, they will burst. Once the milk is frozen, pack the breast milk in your insulated box as tightly as possible. The milk should go into the box first, then the other items to cool and insulate it. Shipping a smaller amount of milk? You can nestle it between layers of ice packs.Pro Tip: If the milk doesn’t fill the box, you’ll want to strategically load up the rest of the box. Add in packing material such as newspaper and then put the frozen gel packs or ice packs on top, cover it with a plastic bag, and then seal it in the box. Want even more peace of mind? Include a temperature monitoring device within your shipment, which can ensure the milk maintains a safe temperature. Finish packaging the shipment by taping it up with duct tape and labeling it. Label requirements may differ across courier services, so inquire about additional information if needed. There are additional methods for packing up your breast milk. For instance, you can use thick-walled Styrofoam coolers and cardboard boxes. Simply store your breast milk storage bags in the cooler and place them in the cardboard box or shipping box. Make sure to choose a cooler that is not too large but is large enough for the ice packs, insulation material, and breast milk.

    "content": "How Long Should You Supply Breast Milk to Intended Parents? As a surrogate, you might be considering providing breast milk postpartum for your intended parents and wondering how to maintain and increase milk supply during this time. his will be a shared decision between you and your intended parents to choose what is best for you, based on what works best for everyone involved. Ultimately, there is no one correct answer to this question; however, there are numerous factors to consider, including the methods you’ll use to maintain and increase milk supply effectively. Assessing Intended Parent Needs The length of time in which you provide breast milk is a shared decision between the surrogate and the intended parents. It will depend on how long the intended parents want breast milk and how long you, as the surrogate, wants to pump. Together, you will decide what the optimal length of time you will provide breast milk. Because breast milk offers a host of health benefits, your intended parents may want it for as long as possible. Newborn babies will not require as much milk; however, as they grow, they will become hungrier and need a larger amount of milk. That being said, the more you pump, the more your body produces. If you are not providing breast milk for your intended family, the intended mother can also breastfeed. Should they need breastfeeding support, they can utilize a Supplemental Nursing System (SNS). Another option is formula feeding. If your intended family does not choose to have you provide breast milk for their baby, you may choose to suppress lactation. You may also choose to continue your giving journey and donate your breast milk. Assessing Surrogate Needs Additionally, you must also consider how long you, as a surrogate, would want to provide breast milk. You have your own unique milk supply you can offer to the baby, but pumping can be a time-consuming, physically challenging, and emotionally challenging process. You may even experience irritation and soreness through your pumping journey. Plus, if you are not local to your intended parents, you will need to evaluate how often you will need to ship breast milk to them. Here are some tips from lactation expert Lenna Gregory on How to Pump, Ship and Donate Your Breast Milk. Understanding The Breast Milk Pumping Timeline If you are still thinking about how long to provide breast milk, gaining a better understanding of the general pumping timeline can be helpful. During Pregnancy & The First Days Milk production begins as soon as the second trimester; your body starts producing colostrum, the first type of breast milk in preparation for providing nourishment after birth. After delivery, you will begin to pump breast milk, and you will be providing transitional milk for about a couple weeks, which is when mature milk typically comes in.As far as baby feeds go, at first, feeding sessions will likely be every two to three hours, though these can start to spread out after the baby’s first week. Keep in mind that, during this time, babies will go through cluster feeding phases. The First Month to 6 Months Old Exclusive breast milk is recommended for the first six months of an infant’s life. Babies will go through growth spurts during this time and may continue to cluster feed. After this time period, they can continue to have breast milk with the introduction of solid foods through their first year or so How to Maintain and Increase Your Milk Supply To maintain and increase your milk supply while pumping breast milk, it’s essential to pump regularly, ideally every 2-3 hours, to effectively mimic your baby’s natural feeding schedule. Using a high-quality breast pump with the correct flange size ensures efficient milk extraction, which helps maintain and increase your milk supply. Staying hydrated, eating a balanced diet, and reducing stress also play a significant role in supporting your milk production. Additionally, incorporating gentle breast massage can stimulate milk flow, further helping to maintain and increase your milk supply. If challenges arise, consulting a lactation consultant can provide tailored advice to optimize your pumping routine.

So, When Is The Right Time? Deciding on the length of time you will provide breast milk is a personal decision. When it comes to their little one, no matter if they are with breast milk, formula, or both, as the saying goes, “fed is best”. Have additional questions about breastfeeding and breast milk?

    "content": "The world of surrogacy is changing rapidly. Yet, not all the words and terms are keeping pace. ConceiveAbilities is committed to refining our process to not only keep up with, but continuing to lead the surrogacy world. And what we hear A LOT from surrogates and intended mothers and families alike, is a simple truth. They do not like to be called a surrogate mother. The term surrogate mother is outdated, even when well-intentioned…and most importantly, not a true representation of modern surrogacy. The surrogate, or gestational carrier, is not the mother. Period. She shares no DNA or genetic relation to the child she is carrying. She will have undergone IVF treatment to receive the embryo of the intended parents; that embryo will have been created with the intended parents’ and/or donor egg and sperm. As one surrogate shared, she is the babysitter, not the mother. We surveyed our experienced surrogates about the term surrogate mother. 80% said they feel the term mother should be dropped completely. Here is what they say you need to know: The surrogate is not the mother.The surrogate is in no way genetically related to the child she is carrying. She does not share any DNA with the child she is carrying. The child a surrogate carries is the intended parent(s)’ child. “I am not the mother of the baby at all,” says surrogate Teale Kelley. Elizabeth Foley says dropping the term “mother” removes the parental feel, saying “I’m just the babysitter until the baby can go home to his parents.” Mother should be saved for the mom.Women become a surrogate to help another person experience the joys of parenthood. They know this is not their baby and they want to ensure that the mother of the child receives the proper title. Samantha Smith feels the word “mother” takes away from the intended mom because “she is still the mother even if she is not carrying the child and should be recognized as so.“ Another surrogate shares, “The mother may already feel that she is losing a lot by needing to use a surrogate and calling someone a surrogate mother can affect the actual mother’s feelings.” It feeds into surrogate myths.Many surrogates think the word mother confuses people and further feeds surrogacy myths and misconceptions. Two-time surrogate Melissa Enke says using the term “mother” makes people think the baby was partially hers. Another surrogate says it leads to the question “how do you not feel horrible giving up a baby?” adding, “I’m not giving up the child, because I’m never the parent.” Elizabeth Foley also feels that the term “mother” leads to questions about her keeping the baby, “Other than the fact that it is actually the largest contract violation, this concept of wanting to keep the baby is inaccurate. Continuing to use the term surrogate mother will cause these misperceptions to carry on and prevent the public from being properly educated on the truly complex process that is gestational surrogacy.” It can be damaging.Oftentimes, intended parents have had an extremely challenging infertility journey and referring to the surrogate as a mother can be hurtful. Through surrogacy, they are able to build their family with a trusted partner. One surrogate shared, “It’s important to me that I am not viewed as the mother. The term mother should be reserved for the actual mother.” Molly Corcoran says she is already planning ahead for her next delivery saying, “I had a delivery at the hospital where I was being called mom by the clinical staff and I had to correct them multiple times. My next journey I put in the birth plan that was given to the hospital to refer to me by my first name.” The surrogate is just the babysitter. She is not the mother.As the number one surrogacy myth, It’s worth repeating. To put a complex matter in a cute way: it is the surrogate’s oven, but not their bun. That said, surrogates are caring and nurturing women. Deanna Mitchell says, “As a surrogate, you care for the baby you are carrying as if it were your own, to substitute as best as possible for how the intended mother would love and care for her baby if she were able to carry it on her own.” 100% of the women we surveyed said they prefer to be called a surrogate, gestational surrogate or gestational carrier (“GC”) without the word mother. So why do we still use the term “Surrogate Mother” on our website? Because we want to share surrogacy with as many people as we possibly can to help grow families. Hear us out. Our research indicates that over 1.3 million women in the United States would be both willing and qualified to be surrogates – if they were educated and knowledgeable about the topic. For those women that are at the earliest stages of learning about surrogacy, they frequently use the term “Surrogate Mother” to search for information about surrogacy. In fact, “Surrogate Mother” is the third highest used search term people use while learning about surrogacy. Following closely behind are these phrases: “What is A Surrogate Mother,” “Surrogate Mother Meaning” and “Surrogate Mother Definition.” Surrogacy can be complex when someone is first introduced to it. Because our goal is to be a leading resource for people who want to learn more about surrogacy, we do use the term “Surrogate Mother” with the intention of helping them get the best information so they can make an informed decision. And, once we have their attention, we help them learn why this particular term is one to be left in the rearview mirror. Curious about how you can help build families by being a surrogate?

The impacts of this shortage still persist. “In our work to help build families for more than twenty-five years, we know that many women find purpose in helping other families at a time of great need,” shared Founder Nazca Fontes, adding, “Like surrogacy, milk banks play a vital role in supporting families. We stand ready to assist all women who are able to help lift up other women, mothers, and families and help provide much needed nutrition to their babies. While there is – yet still – so much work to be done to address the infant formula shortage, we hope an increase of breast milk donations will be a lifeline for these families at this critical time.” Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services, adds, “Our surrogates are incredibly giving and often donate their breast milk after their surrogacy journey. By inspiring more women to donate, we hope those who are facing this uncertainty can rest easy at night knowing they can provide critical nutrition for their babies.” More Resources for Lactating Women: Do you need help finding lactation consultant services?

    "content": "What Is The Definition of Infertility The American Society of Reproduction (ASRM) has redefined infertility to be inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. Infertility is defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner and is inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. In patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at six months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. Nothing in this definition shall be used to deny or delay treatment to any individual, regardless of relationship status or sexual orientation. There are many fertility treatments available for people experiencing infertility: the most successful being surrogacy. Redefining Infertility to Celebrate Every Surrogacy Journey The broadened infertility definition opens doors for more same-sex couples and single individuals to access assisted reproductive technologies, marking a beacon of hope and opportunity. This change is particularly significant, given that some insurance plans rely on ASRM’s definition of infertility to approve fertility treatments. Learn more about infertility. We Are Proud of Our History Helping Hundreds of LGTBQ+ and Single People Have Families As a pioneering surrogacy agency committed to supporting all who aspire to build a family, ConceiveAbilities applauds a groundbreaking development in the United States. The official definition of infertility has undergone a significant expansion, offering newfound hope and opportunities to a wider range of individuals, particularly within the LGBTQ+ community and among single parents. ConceiveAbilities Founder Nazca Fontes, a passionate advocate for modern family-building, enthusiastically lauds the latest initiative by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). This move recognizes and caters to the unique needs of same-sex and single parent communities, marking a monumental step toward inclusivity in the field of reproductive health. “We have always believed everyone who wants to be a parent should be able to. Over our 27 year history, we have assisted hundreds of LGBTQ+ and single people achieve their dreams of parenthood. We wholeheartedly commend ASRM’s latest development in recognizing the need to modernize the definition to include same-sex and single parent communities.” Surrogate Whitney Anderson says this change is a glimmer of hope for all LGBTQ+ families, saying, “I became a surrogatespecifically to help an LGBTQ+ family and I am honored to help them start their family. This new definition for infertility will allow more people to fulfill their dreams of parenthood.” According to Dr. Mark Leondires, Medical Director of Illume Fertility and Founder of Gay Parents To Be, this is a significant step forward for the LGBTQ+ community. He states, “It is a personal passion of mine to help move the needle for the LGBTQ+ community to be able to have children who are an expression of somebody’s love for their partner. As a gay dad myself, I understand how hard it is to get started on a surrogacy journey. This new definition of infertility makes it all the more possible.” The New Inclusive Infertility Definition Makes Parenthood a Reality for LGBTQ+ and Single Communities “Every person, regardless of marital status or sexual preference, with the desire to become a parent should have equal access to the benefits and opportunities to safely and effectively build their family. Today’s definition makes this a reality,” details Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services for ConceiveAbilities. This crucial decision is designed to offer vital support to same-sex couples and single individuals who have encountered barriers to their fertility treatment claims, marking a step toward a more inclusive and compassionate approach to reproductive health and family-building for all. ConceiveAbilities proudly supports and commends this progressive change. ConceiveAbilities is proudly certified by the Family Equality Council as an official Open Door LGBTQ+ family building agency.

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, where I metmy husband in high school. After high school my husband joined the Air Force and I followed him toCalifornia. There we had our amazing son, Isaac, who is 8 years old and our wonderfully sweetdaughter, Harper, who is almost 6. We are growing our roots here in Colorado and loving it. As afamily we enjoy hiking the mountains and playing board games. My personal hobbies include cooking,baking, and creating art. CHRISTINA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY Becoming a gestational surrogate wasn’t a decision I took lightly; it was the culmination of a deepdesire to help others experience the joy of parenthood. My journey into surrogacy began with a simplethought: What if I could be the one to make someone’s dream of having a child come true? Read more about Christina’s decision to become a surrogate not only once, but twice! WHAT MAKES CHRISTINA COURAGEOUS In a world that often seems divided, my journey as a gestational surrogate has taught me that thegreatest gift we can give one another is the gift of love and compassion. It’s about reaching out to helpthose in need, even if they are strangers, and uniting in the beautiful journey of creating families. CHRISTINA’S PURPOSE: The birth of my two children were single handedly the best days of my life. Both of my children’spregnancies were very much planned for and wanted and watching them grow and become their ownpeople is such a rewarding experience. The idea that a friend or family member may go without theamazing, humbling experience of parenthood when they deeply desired it was heartbreaking. Howcould I not step up to help them if I was able? One day while I was browsing the internet an ad forConceiveabilities popped up and I quickly discovered that this selfless act extended beyond ourimmediate circles. I realized that I could help complete strangers on their path to parenthood, and thisrevelation was truly life-changing. If I would help a friend, why was a stranger any different?

    "content": "As told by Brelani Jiminez, ConceiveAbilities Surrogate Why did you decide to become a surrogate?I decided to become a surrogate because of two main reasons: I naturally had easy pregnancies/deliveries and I had a desire to share the indescribable feeling when I held my babies for the first time. I decided that I would love to provide this moment for another couple who has been desiring the opportunity to hold their own babies for so long. What role did your faith play into your decision?After many years of research, discussions with mentors and a lot of prayer, my husband and I decided to pursue surrogacy for many reasons. We think of this journey as adding to our testimony of how beautiful our God is. We had a feeling coming into this that our Intended Parents would have already had a hard and difficult journey. We prayed God would place us in a position to be a beacon of light and a vessel for the Holy Spirit for not only our intended parents, but for all of those that we would come in contact with along the way. We wanted to be a glimmer of hope and light in what would feel like a dark world – and to have the opportunity to share the love of Jesus to a complete stranger, for it is mentioned in the Bible in Acts 20:35, “In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’” To show others that when science and all that mankind can provide has put everything on the table, there is nothing else to credit besides God. How did you share your decision to become a surrogate with your religious community?I decided to share my journey with all (those who are followers of Jesus Christ and those who are not) via social media and by word of mouth. We made this decision to publicly share so that others may find hope in dark places. I love to provide transparency and show others how God has worked absolute wonders in my life and continues to do so everyday. I haven’t had the easiest journey as I envisioned having my first transfer being successful. While my journey has actually been a bit difficult, I have been able to publicly show the many ups and downs throughout this part of my life. How God has helped carry me through has been such a blessing. All of what we have been through and continue to go through will be to bring honor and glory to God. How do you handle negative comments regarding your decision to become a surrogate?I haven’t had many negative comments regarding my decision to become a surrogate, but I have had a lot of questions brought to my attention. The one negative reaction I can recall was from another Christian who told me that she had a message from God. She shared that surrogacy is the way of this world and to turn my focus on God to share His love and light in other ways. She went on to suggest that the idea of me partaking in surrogacy was a role of “playing God.” The message ended with God understanding where my heart is upon this action and He values this; however, the action is incorrect and taking on the ways of this world. When she shared this message, I was heartbroken and distraught for quite a while. As many other Christians would agree, I would never want to violate the will of God, let alone dive right into disobedience head first. My intentions were to never attempt to “play God.” My reasoning to pursue surrogacy was the exact opposite; to share the gospel and His love for His children. I wanted to be a light for God in a dark world filled with hurt and brokenness. Through prayer, reading scripture, meditation, application and some extra prayers, I have come to the realization there will be naysayers, there will be messengers, there will be those who doubt this is the correct way of God’s will. In the end I remember this: my relationship with Jesus Christ and doing the work of the Lord comes down to me, myself, and God. Was it important for you to match with intended parents of the same faith?It was not as important for me to match with intended parents of the same faith; however, it is important to me to abide and align myself with what Biblical principles describe as a couple. Being open to all intended parents no matter their faith while aligning within Biblical principles provides an opportunity for me to love God’s children, to share the light with those who are willing to listen, and hopefully plant a seed in leading them to Christ. What would be your one message to potential surrogates struggling with this decision because of their faith?My one message to women struggling with this decision because of their faith would be: take the leap of faith. Let this be a testimony to God and allow an opportunity to show how powerful and all-knowing He is. As long as your heart posture is in the right place, becoming a surrogate is not an attempt of going against God’s will because, in the end, God still has complete control over all including the results of your surrogacy journey. What better way to demonstrate a glimpse of our Living Hope than to be a vessel for the Holy Spirit and provide a blessing to another couple in a way that could never truly be reciprocated. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family?

    "content": "U.S. Surrogacy Laws By State By Fran Caruso, Esq. ConceiveAbilities is your trusted resource for all things surrogacy including guidance through the legal process. Surrogacy laws vary from state to state and even sometimes county to county. That is why, in addition to our own internal team of expert attorneys, ConceiveAbilities partners with local, state specific attorneys who specialize in reproductive law. Surrogacy laws are ever-changing, but we are here to ensure you feel informed, comfortable, and assured as you proceed forward with the legal process. Below is a brief overview of the current laws impacting surrogacy in relevant states. We are always here to provide additional information and answer your questions so that you can feel confident from the legal perspective as you embark on a surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities. Illinois Illinois is ConceiveAbilities’ home base! In Illinois, gestational surrogacy is permitted via statute and allows intended parents(s) to be declared the legal parent(s) upon birth of the child as long as one intended parent is a genetic contributor to the child. As such, legal parentage is determined upon birth and intended parents can obtain a birth certificate from vital statistics directly. If the statute’s requirements are not met, or if a court order is needed for other reasons, then parentage may be determined via a post-birth order. Finally, if both egg donor and sperm donor are used, parental rights would be obtained via an adoption proceeding.Get more information about surrogacy in Illinois. New York As of February 15, 2021, compensated gestational surrogacy was made legal in New York via its new statute: the Child Parent Security Act (CPSA). The CPSA includes the Surrogate’s Bill of Rights–the first of its kind in the industry–as well as many requirements for the gestational carrier agreements. You can learn more about the CPSA and its impact on the surrogacy industry here.Notably, ConceiveAbilities was one of the first surrogacy agencies to be licensed by the New York Department of Health. To comply with the CPSA, ConceiveAbilities ensures that its intended parents and gestational carriers have experienced, well-versed reproductive attorneys who are knowledgeable of the CPSA. Under the CPSA, New York courts will grant pre-birth orders for all intended parents regardless of genetic contributors, marital status, or sexual orientation who are parties to a compensated surrogacy arrangement; and the order will go into effect at the time of the birth.Get more information about surrogacy in New York. Colorado Gestational surrogacy is legal in Colorado via the Colorado Surrogacy Agreement Act. The law protects both the intended parents and the gestational carrier who have entered into gestational carrier agreements consistent with the law. ConceiveAbilities ensures that during the drafting of the gestational carrier agreement all parties are represented by attorneys licensed in Colorado as is required by the law. Intended parents can proceed with a gestational carrier in Colorado regardless of their marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or need for surrogacy. Parentage can be determined via a pre-birth order from the juvenile court and said order will vest the intended parents with all parental rights and duties to the child immediately upon birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Colorado. California California is often thought of as the “friendliest” state for surrogacy and for good reason—California was the first state to enact a statute that makes surrogacy available to all! And while there are other states that are similarly as supportive and legally secure, California remains one of the most sought after states for surrogacy. Intended Parents, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy, can obtain a pre-birth order. This is true so long as any portion of the surrogacy occurred in California–specifically: (1) the county where the child is anticipated to be born, (2) the county where the intended parent(s) reside, (3) the county where the gestational carrier resides, (4) the county where the assisted reproduction agreement for gestational carrier is executed, or (5) the county where medical procedures pursuant to the GCA (i.e. embryo transfers) are to be performed. The pre-birth order becomes effective at the moment of birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Southern California and Northern California Oregon Although there are no specific surrogacy laws in Oregon, there are laws that contemplate the relationship between the intended parent(s) and a child conceived via assisted reproductive technology. Furthermore, there are no specific statutes or case law that prohibit surrogacy. Surrogacy is safely practiced in Oregon and is available to any and all types of intended parents who will legally be declared the parents of the child. Most judges issue pre-birth orders if there is a genetic connection between the intended parent(s) and child and in some cases even when there is not a genetic connection. Post-birth orders are also available if needed.Get more information about surrogacy in Oregon. Washington Rounding out the surrogacy friendly states of the west coast is Washington. As of January 1, 2019, Washington enacted a parentage statute that provides for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders. Pre-birth orders are granted regardless of the intended parent(s) marital status, sexual preference, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy. Pre-birth orders go into effect upon the birth of the child. Washington law defines who can be a “gestational surrogate” and provides specific details as to what terms need to be included in the gestational carrier for it to be enforceable. Specifically, a gestational carrier may not have completed more than two (2) surrogacies.Therefore, for all parties’ protection, it is critical that intended parents and gestational carriers work with experienced surrogacy professionals, like those at ConceiveAbilities, who are well versed in the specific requirements in Washington.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington. Minnesota Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Minnesota as no statute or published case law prohibits surrogacy. Surrogacy is available to Intended Parents regardless of marital status or genetic connection. Although many courts in several counties will grant pre-birth declaratory judgments, the more likely course of action is that parentage will be determined post-birth, especially if donor material was used. The relevant paperwork can be filed pre-birth, but it will not be granted until after birth. Additionally, a hearing is oftentimes required by the presiding judge meaning that all parties should anticipate remaining in Minnesota until the necessary legal work is completed. Arguably the most notable aspect of surrogacy in Minnesota is that if a judge will not sign a pre-birth declaratory judgment, a non-genetic parent will need to obtain a second parent adoption post-birth to confer parental rights. While the optics of this is not ideal, as it is the intended parents’ child, it is a critical step to ensure that all intended parents have equal legal rights to their child. The second parent adoption is typically completed quickly after birth in conjunction with the other post-birth legal proceedings in order to ensure both parents are named on the birth certificate.Get more information about surrogacy in Minnesota. Massachusetts Gestational surrogacy is supported in Massachusetts by three notable cases decided by the Commonwealth’s superior Court – Hodas v. Morin (2004); Culliton v. Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr. (2002); and R.R. v. M.H. (1998). Married and unmarried couples and single individuals, regardless of sexual orientation and/or genetic connection, may obtain a pre-birth order. A hearing is typically not required but is ultimately up to the judge’s discretion.Get more information about surrogacy in Massachusetts. Nevada Not to be outdone by its neighboring state of California, Nevada also has a surrogacy statute that permits gestational surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need. Pre-birth and post-birth orders are available. The Nevada statute specifically provides that parties may enter into gestational carrier agreements which contemplate payment of consideration for surrogacy services. The statute also requires that the gestational carrier agreement expressly state that the gestational carrier and her legal spouse/partner relinquish all rights and duties to the child conceived through assisted reproduction and that it is the intended parent(s) who are the parents of any resulting child. While the gestational carrier agreement would already state this regardless of the prevailing state law, Nevada has appropriately made this a statutory requirement for any gestational carrier agreement. Way to go Nevada!Get more information about surrogacy in Nevada. Pennsylvania Although there is no surrogacy statute in Pennsylvania, gestational surrogacy is still permitted and practiced. Pennsylvania declared in a 2006 case that a surrogacy contract is not contrary to public policy and that the gestational carrier is not the “legal mother.” Furthermore, in 2015, the Superior Court confirmed the enforceability of gestational carrier agreements as well as intended parents legal parentage to the child regardless of any genetic connection. Pre-birth orders are available, although this sometimes varies based on the specific county and judge, particularly if donor material is used. However, thanks to these court decisions, parties can safely proceed with gestational surrogacy in Pennsylvania.Get more information about surrogacy in Pennsylvania. Maryland Maryland has been a favorable state for gestational surrogacy since 2003. Similar to other states, parties are able to safely practice gestational surrogacy thanks to a favorable court decision (as compared to an explicit statute). Maryland’s highest court implicitly approved gestational surrogacy by determining that a gestational carrier is not required to be listed as the “mother” on the birth certificate of the child thereby leading to having the intended parents exclusively listed. Regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection, Intended Parents are able to establish their parental rights pre-birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Maryland. Georgia Despite no statutory or case law directly addressing surrogacy contracts in Georgia, it is a favorable state for gestational surrogacy. Courts regularly establish parental rights for Intended Parents through a pre-birth declaratory judgment regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic connection (although there may be additional paperwork required). The court process is typically very seamless – everything is usually handled directly between attorneys and usually no in-person hearing is required, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Georgia. Virginia Many are surprised to learn that surrogacy is authorized by statute in Virginia. Virginia’s “Status of Children of Assisted Conception” is unique because although it contemplates court approval process, this can only be done prior to embryo transfer and is not a pre-birth parentage order. It is instead a lengthy court process more akin to an adoption proceeding–home studies for all parties, the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the unborn child, and a full trial-like court hearing. Therefore, almost all Intended Parents bypass this and opt to establish their parental rights post-birth either through the administrative process contemplated in the statute or an order of parentage from the court. One other unique note for Virginia, the gestational carrier cannot sign any of the documents until 72 hours after the child is born. Finally, Virginia has a marital requirement for couples pursuing gestational surrogacy, but there need not be any genetic connection so long as ownership of the embryo can be proven. Ohio As of 2007, the Ohio Supreme Court has confirmed that gestational surrogacy is not against public policy and therefore gestational surrogacy is readily practiced in Ohio. While pre-birth orders are granted, they are discretionary meaning they are somewhat variable depending on the county. However, most counties will issue a pre-birth order for married Intended Parents, unmarried heterosexual couples, or singles regardless of sexual orientation or genetics. If not possible, Intended Parents can obtain a post-birth order to secure their parental rights.Get more information about surrogacy in Ohio. North Carolina Gestational surrogacy is practiced in North Carolina as there is no prohibition of it by either case law or statute. While most intended parents are able to obtain a pre-birth parentage, in some rare occasions parentage may be determined post-birth. The biggest factor is the intended parents’ marital status and genetic connection to the child. One specificity as to North Carolina gestational surrogacy is that when a known donor is used, the donor will also to be a party to the parentage legal proceedings. Nevertheless, single genetic parents, married and unmarried heterosexual couples with at least one genetic parent, and married same-sex couples with one genetic parent traditionally have no issue obtaining pre-birth orders as a matter of course.Get more information about surrogacy in North Carolina. Alabama Alabama courts regularly recognize gestational surrogacy and establish parental rights for married couples and single Intended Parents regardless of genetic connection. More often than not, Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth declaratory judgment; in cases where that is not allowed (based on the county), Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth consent which becomes effective five days after delivery of the child. Ultimately, a post birth order may be necessary.Get more information about surrogacy in Alabama. Florida In Florida, gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Ch.742.15 FL Stat.) but only for married couples. However, surrogacy is still available to unmarried and single Intended Parents in Florida via court orders so long as one Intended Parent has a genetic connection. Although technically providing pre-birth orders, Florida is unique in that the pre-birth orders act more as interim orders for medical decisions and paternity. A post birth order must be obtained before a birth certificate containing the Intended Parents’ names will be issued. Florida also has a strict medical need requirement with the statute providing specific medical requirements such as the Intended Mother is not able to physically gestate a pregnancy to term.Get more information about surrogacy in Florida. New Jersey In 2018, the Gestational Carrier Agreement Act went into effect in New Jersey. The Act provided for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders for all types of Intended Parents in accordance with specific conditions. For example, the gestational carrier agreement must be in writing, all parties must have completed mental health evaluations, and independent legal representation must have been provided for the gestational carrier and Intended Parents. These requirements and protections make New Jersey a very surrogacy friendly state.Get more information about surrogacy in New Jersey. Texas By statute, Texas permits gestational surrogacy for married intended parents (Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 160.752, § 160.753, § 160.754). Under the law, the “gestational agreement” (aka GCA) must be validated by the court to be enforceable and confer parental rights. If the parties have a validated gestational carrier agreement, married Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth order. For Intended Parents who are not married, or those who are single, judges have the discretion to grant pre-birth orders. The Texas statute also contemplates the option of a post-birth order. Regardless of pre-birth or post-birth, there must be a genetic connection between the IPs and the child. For unmarried IPs, the non-genetic parent would need to complete a second parent adoption. One unique aspect of the Texas law is that the gestational carrier agreement needs to be validated to be enforceable.Get more information about surrogacy in Texas. Wisconsin Wisconsin’s Supreme Court ruled in the 2013 case of Paternity of F.T.R., Rosecky v. Schissel that surrogacy contracts are enforceable so long as they are not contrary to the best interests of the child. Typically, intended parents, regardless of marital status, can obtain parentage orders placing their names on the birth certificate so long as one parent is genetically related to the child. If neither intended parent is genetically related to the child, a parentage order may be granted but this will depend on the particular county and judge. Additionally, while parentage orders are often issued pre-birth, they are considered “interim” orders and require a subsequent, final order issued after the child’s birth to facilitate obtaining the birth certificate. Finally, in many cases a hearing is required where all parties may be expected to appear.Get more information about surrogacy in Wisconsin. Connecticut The Connecticut Parentage Act (CPA) provides a protected path to parentage for any intended parents pursuing gestational surrogacy. The CPA ensures that all Connecticut children – regardless of the circumstances of their birth or the marital status, gender, or sexual orientation of their parents – have equal access to the security of a legal parent-child relationship. Furthermore, Connecticut has a statute that requires Vital Records to comply with court orders in issuing a birth certificate naming the intended parents in a gestational surrogacy arrangement as the parents. Parentage orders are granted pre-birth, but an in-person healing with all parties (intended parents, gestational carrier, and gestational carrier spouse) tends to be required.Get more information about surrogacy in Connecticut. Indiana At first blush, Indiana may not seem like an ideal state for surrogacy as there is a statute that voids gestational carrier agreements. However, Indiana attorneys advise that said statute only applies to traditional surrogacy (where the surrogate is genetically related to the child), not gestational surrogacy. For added protection, gestational carrier agreements, where the gestational carrier resides in Indiana will likely be drafted using the state law where the Intended Parents or fertility clinic are located. Nonetheless, gestational surrogacy is widely practiced in Indiana and courts regularly grant parental rights via pre and post birth parentage orders to married Intended Parents who have some genetic connection to the child. Single intended parents may also obtain a pre-birth order if genetically related to the child, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Indiana. Washington, D.C.Our nation’s capital has an express surrogacy statute. DC statutes (DC Law §§ 16-401 – 16-412) provide that all Intended Parents can obtain pre-birth orders establishing their parentage regardless of genetic connection, marital status, sexual orientation or need for surrogacy. Said orders do not become effective until the moment of birth and either the intended parents or gestational carrier need to have resided in DC for at least one (1) year. If neither party meets the residency requirement, a post-birth order can be obtained.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington, DC. Alaska With no case law or statute prohibiting surrogacy, gestational surrogacy is permitted and practiced in Alaska. It is generally anticipated that courts will establish parentage pre-birth for intended parents regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic link to the expected child, but due to limited surrogacy matters in the area, it is best pursued by heterosexual parents who are married using embryos with their own genetics. A hearing is most likely required and all parties may be ordered to appear with most cases being filed and heard in Anchorage. Arizona Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Arizona pursuant to a 1994 appellate court decision (Soos v. Superior Court) and courts acknowledge certain parental rights via court order. Some courts will allow pre-birth orders, but many courts wait until after the birth of the child before entering a maternity order. An intended father who is the biological contributor can be listed on the birth certificate without any order through the use of a paternity affidavit in conjunction with a denial of paternity affidavit by the gestational carrier’s husband if the gestational carrier is married.Notably, surrogacy contracts are unenforceable and prohibited by statute (Arizona Revised Statute § 25-218). So how do the parties lay out the terms of their agreement? Most commonly, in lieu of Arizona law, the prevailing law of the gestational carrier agreement will be that of another state that has a connection to the surrogacy arrangement, not Arizona; this state is most commonly California. If there is a California connection to the surrogacy (e.g. one Party lives in CA or the Fertility Center is located in CA), the Parties can also bypass court proceedings in Arizona and instead obtain a court order from California. These court orders are routinely accepted by Arizona hospitals and Vital Records.Ultimately, there are several nuances with the Arizona process which is why it is critical to work with an experienced assisted reproduction technology attorney that is knowledgeable of the Arizona process. Arkansas Surrogacy is statutorily permitted in Arkansas (Code § 9-10-201) and there is flexibility in the establishment of parental rights with married intended parents able to obtain pre-birth orders. However, unmarried intended parents who create embryos with donor material will require a second parent adoption in their home state as only the biological parent can obtain a pre-birth order. Furthermore, pursuant to the statute, vital records shall initially list the gestational carrier on the birth certificate documents and then permanently amend such records to name the intended parents as the true legal parents; even when a pre-birth order has been issued. Delaware Delaware may be small but it sure is mighty when it comes to surrogacy. Gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Delaware Code 13, § 8-801 – § 8-810) for any and all IPs regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, and genetic relationship to the child. Parentage is established pre-birth and the statute explicitly provides that the gestational carrier is “not a parent of a child born as a result of a gestational carrier arrangement” so long as specified requirements are met in the arrangement. Hawaii There is no existing statute or case law in Hawaii that prohibits surrogacy so it is freely practiced so long as there is a genetic connection between the intended parents and the child. If the embryo was created with the assistance of an egg or sperm donor, the non-biological parent must complete a second parent adoption either in Hawaii or their home state, in order for the child’s birth certificate to show them both as the parents. For the non-biological parent, parentage can only be established post-birth. However, a hearing for the parentage order typically requires at least the gestational carrier and her spouse, if applicable, to attend in person. Idaho As of July 1, 2023, Idaho Gestational Agreements Act went into effect making Idaho a favorable state for surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection. Under the new law, the parties can file a petition to have their gestational carrier agreement validated pre-birth which in turn makes it enforceable under the statute. Upon finding that the gestational carrier agreement is valid, the court shall issue an order validating the agreement and declaring that the intended parents are/will be the parent(s) of any child born under the terms of the agreement. Then post-birth, the court will issue a validation order and an order of parentage confirming that the intended parents are the parent(s) of the child. Iowa Surrogacy is implicitly permitted in Iowa from a culmination of three legal premises: (1) Iowa Code provides that surrogacy agreements are exempt from Iowa’s law prohibiting the purchase or sale of an individual, (2) Iowa’s administrative code addresses the issuance of birth certificates for children born to a gestational carrier (Iowa Admin. Code r. 641-99.15(144)), and (3) the Iowa Supreme Court held in 2018 that gestational carrier agreements are enforceable and do not violate public policy or the constitutional rights of the gestational carrier or child (P.M. & C.M. v. T.B. & D.B). Furthermore, in the same case, the court stated that gestational carrier agreements “promote families by enabling infertile couples to raise their own children and help bring new life into this world through willing surrogate mothers.”As a result of this, parentage in Iowa is established in two (2) parts. First, parentage is only to be established before birth for the biological father, resulting in a birth certificate listing the biological father with gestational carrier. Then post-birth a second order is necessary to permanently change the child’s birth certificate to list the second parent. This second order is either a parentage order for the other genetic parent or an adoption for a non-genetic parent. Have you thought about becoming a surrogate?

    "content": "By Ashtin Gurevitz, a Two-Time Surrogate and ConceiveAbilities Surrogate Intake Manager Surrogacy has always been my calling. I knew I wanted to help someone have a family since I can remember. When I started dating my husband, who is also my high school sweetheart, I let him know becoming a surrogate was part of my plan. After completing our own beautiful family of three children, we decided the time was right. I knew my gift of surrogacy would change someone’s life, but I never dreamed it would change my life like it has. Matching with My Intended Parents Matching was the most important thing for me and my family. Matching with Brian and Scott, a loving gay couple from New York, was a dream come true. I always knew I wanted to work with a same-sex couple, and our connection was instant. I still get emotional about our first meeting. Throughout the pregnancy, Brian and Scott were amazing intended parents. We communicated regularly, and they visited us during important milestones. Their involvement made the journey feel like a shared experience, strengthening our bond that will last a lifetime. The Birth The day of delivery is the moment every surrogate dreams of. It’s hard to even put the excitement into words. I was surrounded by my husband, Jeff, who is my biggest cheerleader, and my best friend, Hannah, a birthing photographer who was capturing every moment. My focus was on Brian and Scott, who were there to witness the arrival of their son, Silas. When Silas was born, the emotions in the room were overwhelming. Seeing the happiness and love in Brian and Scott’s eyes was a moment I will cherish forever. I am so grateful to have these photos and video of this incredible moment. The Sibling Journey The journey did not end there. Soon after delivering Silas, I decided to do a sibling surrogacy journey with Brian and Scott, carrying their second child, Sloane, who completed their family. Becoming a surrogate has been a transformational experience for me. It has taught me the power of giving. Knowing that I played a part in building a family has left an indelible mark on my heart. Sharing Surrogacy Now I work at ConceiveAbilities to help other women fulfill their calling of becoming a surrogate. It is a unique opportunity to create a family, forge lifelong connections, and experience the magic of childbirth in a profound way. To anyone considering surrogacy, I encourage you to embrace the journey with an open heart and mind. There may be challenges, but the reward of witnessing a family come together is priceless. Surrogacy has changed my life in ways I could have never imagined, and I will forever be grateful for this incredible experience. Learn more about becoming a surrogate.

    "content": "When talking about surrogacy laws in New York, it is impossible to not mention Andy Cohen and his own journey with surrogacy. Cohen’s daughter, Lucy, was one of the very first babies born in NYC under the new surrogacy laws. Cohen was frustrated by the laws prohibiting gestational surrogacy in his home state, so took matters into his own hands to advocate for surrogacy’s legalization. “I wanted my surrogate to have the baby in New York”, Cohen states, as his motivation to push this law through and get surrogacy legal in New York. ConceiveAbilities is proud to be among the first surrogacy agencies to be licensed in New York.

    "content": "U.S. Surrogacy Laws By State By Fran Caruso, Esq. ConceiveAbilities is your trusted resource for all things surrogacy including guidance through the legal process. Surrogacy laws vary from state to state and even sometimes county to county. That is why, in addition to our own internal team of expert attorneys, ConceiveAbilities partners with local, state specific attorneys who specialize in reproductive law. Surrogacy laws are ever-changing, but we are here to ensure you feel informed, comfortable, and assured as you proceed forward with the legal process. Below is a brief overview of the current laws impacting surrogacy in relevant states. We are always here to provide additional information and answer your questions so that you can feel confident from the legal perspective as you embark on a surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities. Illinois Illinois is ConceiveAbilities’ home base! In Illinois, gestational surrogacy is permitted via statute and allows intended parents(s) to be declared the legal parent(s) upon birth of the child as long as one intended parent is a genetic contributor to the child. As such, legal parentage is determined upon birth and intended parents can obtain a birth certificate from vital statistics directly. If the statute’s requirements are not met, or if a court order is needed for other reasons, then parentage may be determined via a post-birth order. Finally, if both egg donor and sperm donor are used, parental rights would be obtained via an adoption proceeding.Get more information about surrogacy in Illinois. New York As of February 15, 2021, compensated gestational surrogacy was made legal in New York via its new statute: the Child Parent Security Act (CPSA). The CPSA includes the Surrogate’s Bill of Rights–the first of its kind in the industry–as well as many requirements for the gestational carrier agreements. You can learn more about the CPSA and its impact on the surrogacy industry here.Notably, ConceiveAbilities was one of the first surrogacy agencies to be licensed by the New York Department of Health. To comply with the CPSA, ConceiveAbilities ensures that its intended parents and gestational carriers have experienced, well-versed reproductive attorneys who are knowledgeable of the CPSA. Under the CPSA, New York courts will grant pre-birth orders for all intended parents regardless of genetic contributors, marital status, or sexual orientation who are parties to a compensated surrogacy arrangement; and the order will go into effect at the time of the birth.Get more information about surrogacy in New York. Colorado Gestational surrogacy is legal in Colorado via the Colorado Surrogacy Agreement Act. The law protects both the intended parents and the gestational carrier who have entered into gestational carrier agreements consistent with the law. ConceiveAbilities ensures that during the drafting of the gestational carrier agreement all parties are represented by attorneys licensed in Colorado as is required by the law. Intended parents can proceed with a gestational carrier in Colorado regardless of their marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or need for surrogacy. Parentage can be determined via a pre-birth order from the juvenile court and said order will vest the intended parents with all parental rights and duties to the child immediately upon birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Colorado. California California is often thought of as the “friendliest” state for surrogacy and for good reason—California was the first state to enact a statute that makes surrogacy available to all! And while there are other states that are similarly as supportive and legally secure, California remains one of the most sought after states for surrogacy. Intended Parents, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy, can obtain a pre-birth order. This is true so long as any portion of the surrogacy occurred in California–specifically: (1) the county where the child is anticipated to be born, (2) the county where the intended parent(s) reside, (3) the county where the gestational carrier resides, (4) the county where the assisted reproduction agreement for gestational carrier is executed, or (5) the county where medical procedures pursuant to the GCA (i.e. embryo transfers) are to be performed. The pre-birth order becomes effective at the moment of birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Southern California and Northern California Oregon Although there are no specific surrogacy laws in Oregon, there are laws that contemplate the relationship between the intended parent(s) and a child conceived via assisted reproductive technology. Furthermore, there are no specific statutes or case law that prohibit surrogacy. Surrogacy is safely practiced in Oregon and is available to any and all types of intended parents who will legally be declared the parents of the child. Most judges issue pre-birth orders if there is a genetic connection between the intended parent(s) and child and in some cases even when there is not a genetic connection. Post-birth orders are also available if needed.Get more information about surrogacy in Oregon. Washington Rounding out the surrogacy friendly states of the west coast is Washington. As of January 1, 2019, Washington enacted a parentage statute that provides for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders. Pre-birth orders are granted regardless of the intended parent(s) marital status, sexual preference, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy. Pre-birth orders go into effect upon the birth of the child. Washington law defines who can be a “gestational surrogate” and provides specific details as to what terms need to be included in the gestational carrier for it to be enforceable. Specifically, a gestational carrier may not have completed more than two (2) surrogacies.Therefore, for all parties’ protection, it is critical that intended parents and gestational carriers work with experienced surrogacy professionals, like those at ConceiveAbilities, who are well versed in the specific requirements in Washington.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington. Minnesota Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Minnesota as no statute or published case law prohibits surrogacy. Surrogacy is available to Intended Parents regardless of marital status or genetic connection. Although many courts in several counties will grant pre-birth declaratory judgments, the more likely course of action is that parentage will be determined post-birth, especially if donor material was used. The relevant paperwork can be filed pre-birth, but it will not be granted until after birth. Additionally, a hearing is oftentimes required by the presiding judge meaning that all parties should anticipate remaining in Minnesota until the necessary legal work is completed. Arguably the most notable aspect of surrogacy in Minnesota is that if a judge will not sign a pre-birth declaratory judgment, a non-genetic parent will need to obtain a second parent adoption post-birth to confer parental rights. While the optics of this is not ideal, as it is the intended parents’ child, it is a critical step to ensure that all intended parents have equal legal rights to their child. The second parent adoption is typically completed quickly after birth in conjunction with the other post-birth legal proceedings in order to ensure both parents are named on the birth certificate.Get more information about surrogacy in Minnesota. Massachusetts Gestational surrogacy is supported in Massachusetts by three notable cases decided by the Commonwealth’s superior Court – Hodas v. Morin (2004); Culliton v. Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr. (2002); and R.R. v. M.H. (1998). Married and unmarried couples and single individuals, regardless of sexual orientation and/or genetic connection, may obtain a pre-birth order. A hearing is typically not required but is ultimately up to the judge’s discretion.Get more information about surrogacy in Massachusetts. Nevada Not to be outdone by its neighboring state of California, Nevada also has a surrogacy statute that permits gestational surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need. Pre-birth and post-birth orders are available. The Nevada statute specifically provides that parties may enter into gestational carrier agreements which contemplate payment of consideration for surrogacy services. The statute also requires that the gestational carrier agreement expressly state that the gestational carrier and her legal spouse/partner relinquish all rights and duties to the child conceived through assisted reproduction and that it is the intended parent(s) who are the parents of any resulting child. While the gestational carrier agreement would already state this regardless of the prevailing state law, Nevada has appropriately made this a statutory requirement for any gestational carrier agreement. Way to go Nevada!Get more information about surrogacy in Nevada. Pennsylvania Although there is no surrogacy statute in Pennsylvania, gestational surrogacy is still permitted and practiced. Pennsylvania declared in a 2006 case that a surrogacy contract is not contrary to public policy and that the gestational carrier is not the “legal mother.” Furthermore, in 2015, the Superior Court confirmed the enforceability of gestational carrier agreements as well as intended parents legal parentage to the child regardless of any genetic connection. Pre-birth orders are available, although this sometimes varies based on the specific county and judge, particularly if donor material is used. However, thanks to these court decisions, parties can safely proceed with gestational surrogacy in Pennsylvania.Get more information about surrogacy in Pennsylvania. Maryland Maryland has been a favorable state for gestational surrogacy since 2003. Similar to other states, parties are able to safely practice gestational surrogacy thanks to a favorable court decision (as compared to an explicit statute). Maryland’s highest court implicitly approved gestational surrogacy by determining that a gestational carrier is not required to be listed as the “mother” on the birth certificate of the child thereby leading to having the intended parents exclusively listed. Regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection, Intended Parents are able to establish their parental rights pre-birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Maryland. Georgia Despite no statutory or case law directly addressing surrogacy contracts in Georgia, it is a favorable state for gestational surrogacy. Courts regularly establish parental rights for Intended Parents through a pre-birth declaratory judgment regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic connection (although there may be additional paperwork required). The court process is typically very seamless – everything is usually handled directly between attorneys and usually no in-person hearing is required, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Georgia. Virginia Many are surprised to learn that surrogacy is authorized by statute in Virginia. Virginia’s “Status of Children of Assisted Conception” is unique because although it contemplates court approval process, this can only be done prior to embryo transfer and is not a pre-birth parentage order. It is instead a lengthy court process more akin to an adoption proceeding–home studies for all parties, the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the unborn child, and a full trial-like court hearing. Therefore, almost all Intended Parents bypass this and opt to establish their parental rights post-birth either through the administrative process contemplated in the statute or an order of parentage from the court. One other unique note for Virginia, the gestational carrier cannot sign any of the documents until 72 hours after the child is born. Finally, Virginia has a marital requirement for couples pursuing gestational surrogacy, but there need not be any genetic connection so long as ownership of the embryo can be proven. Ohio As of 2007, the Ohio Supreme Court has confirmed that gestational surrogacy is not against public policy and therefore gestational surrogacy is readily practiced in Ohio. While pre-birth orders are granted, they are discretionary meaning they are somewhat variable depending on the county. However, most counties will issue a pre-birth order for married Intended Parents, unmarried heterosexual couples, or singles regardless of sexual orientation or genetics. If not possible, Intended Parents can obtain a post-birth order to secure their parental rights.Get more information about surrogacy in Ohio. North Carolina Gestational surrogacy is practiced in North Carolina as there is no prohibition of it by either case law or statute. While most intended parents are able to obtain a pre-birth parentage, in some rare occasions parentage may be determined post-birth. The biggest factor is the intended parents’ marital status and genetic connection to the child. One specificity as to North Carolina gestational surrogacy is that when a known donor is used, the donor will also to be a party to the parentage legal proceedings. Nevertheless, single genetic parents, married and unmarried heterosexual couples with at least one genetic parent, and married same-sex couples with one genetic parent traditionally have no issue obtaining pre-birth orders as a matter of course.Get more information about surrogacy in North Carolina. Alabama Alabama courts regularly recognize gestational surrogacy and establish parental rights for married couples and single Intended Parents regardless of genetic connection. More often than not, Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth declaratory judgment; in cases where that is not allowed (based on the county), Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth consent which becomes effective five days after delivery of the child. Ultimately, a post birth order may be necessary.Get more information about surrogacy in Alabama. Florida In Florida, gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Ch.742.15 FL Stat.) but only for married couples. However, surrogacy is still available to unmarried and single Intended Parents in Florida via court orders so long as one Intended Parent has a genetic connection. Although technically providing pre-birth orders, Florida is unique in that the pre-birth orders act more as interim orders for medical decisions and paternity. A post birth order must be obtained before a birth certificate containing the Intended Parents’ names will be issued. Florida also has a strict medical need requirement with the statute providing specific medical requirements such as the Intended Mother is not able to physically gestate a pregnancy to term.Get more information about surrogacy in Florida. New Jersey In 2018, the Gestational Carrier Agreement Act went into effect in New Jersey. The Act provided for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders for all types of Intended Parents in accordance with specific conditions. For example, the gestational carrier agreement must be in writing, all parties must have completed mental health evaluations, and independent legal representation must have been provided for the gestational carrier and Intended Parents. These requirements and protections make New Jersey a very surrogacy friendly state.Get more information about surrogacy in New Jersey. Texas By statute, Texas permits gestational surrogacy for married intended parents (Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 160.752, § 160.753, § 160.754). Under the law, the “gestational agreement” (aka GCA) must be validated by the court to be enforceable and confer parental rights. If the parties have a validated gestational carrier agreement, married Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth order. For Intended Parents who are not married, or those who are single, judges have the discretion to grant pre-birth orders. The Texas statute also contemplates the option of a post-birth order. Regardless of pre-birth or post-birth, there must be a genetic connection between the IPs and the child. For unmarried IPs, the non-genetic parent would need to complete a second parent adoption. One unique aspect of the Texas law is that the gestational carrier agreement needs to be validated to be enforceable.Get more information about surrogacy in Texas. Wisconsin Wisconsin’s Supreme Court ruled in the 2013 case of Paternity of F.T.R., Rosecky v. Schissel that surrogacy contracts are enforceable so long as they are not contrary to the best interests of the child. Typically, intended parents, regardless of marital status, can obtain parentage orders placing their names on the birth certificate so long as one parent is genetically related to the child. If neither intended parent is genetically related to the child, a parentage order may be granted but this will depend on the particular county and judge. Additionally, while parentage orders are often issued pre-birth, they are considered “interim” orders and require a subsequent, final order issued after the child’s birth to facilitate obtaining the birth certificate. Finally, in many cases a hearing is required where all parties may be expected to appear.Get more information about surrogacy in Wisconsin. Connecticut The Connecticut Parentage Act (CPA) provides a protected path to parentage for any intended parents pursuing gestational surrogacy. The CPA ensures that all Connecticut children – regardless of the circumstances of their birth or the marital status, gender, or sexual orientation of their parents – have equal access to the security of a legal parent-child relationship. Furthermore, Connecticut has a statute that requires Vital Records to comply with court orders in issuing a birth certificate naming the intended parents in a gestational surrogacy arrangement as the parents. Parentage orders are granted pre-birth, but an in-person healing with all parties (intended parents, gestational carrier, and gestational carrier spouse) tends to be required.Get more information about surrogacy in Connecticut. Indiana At first blush, Indiana may not seem like an ideal state for surrogacy as there is a statute that voids gestational carrier agreements. However, Indiana attorneys advise that said statute only applies to traditional surrogacy (where the surrogate is genetically related to the child), not gestational surrogacy. For added protection, gestational carrier agreements, where the gestational carrier resides in Indiana will likely be drafted using the state law where the Intended Parents or fertility clinic are located. Nonetheless, gestational surrogacy is widely practiced in Indiana and courts regularly grant parental rights via pre and post birth parentage orders to married Intended Parents who have some genetic connection to the child. Single intended parents may also obtain a pre-birth order if genetically related to the child, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Indiana. Washington, D.C.Our nation’s capital has an express surrogacy statute. DC statutes (DC Law §§ 16-401 – 16-412) provide that all Intended Parents can obtain pre-birth orders establishing their parentage regardless of genetic connection, marital status, sexual orientation or need for surrogacy. Said orders do not become effective until the moment of birth and either the intended parents or gestational carrier need to have resided in DC for at least one (1) year. If neither party meets the residency requirement, a post-birth order can be obtained.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington, DC. Alaska With no case law or statute prohibiting surrogacy, gestational surrogacy is permitted and practiced in Alaska. It is generally anticipated that courts will establish parentage pre-birth for intended parents regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic link to the expected child, but due to limited surrogacy matters in the area, it is best pursued by heterosexual parents who are married using embryos with their own genetics. A hearing is most likely required and all parties may be ordered to appear with most cases being filed and heard in Anchorage. Arizona Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Arizona pursuant to a 1994 appellate court decision (Soos v. Superior Court) and courts acknowledge certain parental rights via court order. Some courts will allow pre-birth orders, but many courts wait until after the birth of the child before entering a maternity order. An intended father who is the biological contributor can be listed on the birth certificate without any order through the use of a paternity affidavit in conjunction with a denial of paternity affidavit by the gestational carrier’s husband if the gestational carrier is married.Notably, surrogacy contracts are unenforceable and prohibited by statute (Arizona Revised Statute § 25-218). So how do the parties lay out the terms of their agreement? Most commonly, in lieu of Arizona law, the prevailing law of the gestational carrier agreement will be that of another state that has a connection to the surrogacy arrangement, not Arizona; this state is most commonly California. If there is a California connection to the surrogacy (e.g. one Party lives in CA or the Fertility Center is located in CA), the Parties can also bypass court proceedings in Arizona and instead obtain a court order from California. These court orders are routinely accepted by Arizona hospitals and Vital Records.Ultimately, there are several nuances with the Arizona process which is why it is critical to work with an experienced assisted reproduction technology attorney that is knowledgeable of the Arizona process. Arkansas Surrogacy is statutorily permitted in Arkansas (Code § 9-10-201) and there is flexibility in the establishment of parental rights with married intended parents able to obtain pre-birth orders. However, unmarried intended parents who create embryos with donor material will require a second parent adoption in their home state as only the biological parent can obtain a pre-birth order. Furthermore, pursuant to the statute, vital records shall initially list the gestational carrier on the birth certificate documents and then permanently amend such records to name the intended parents as the true legal parents; even when a pre-birth order has been issued. Delaware Delaware may be small but it sure is mighty when it comes to surrogacy. Gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Delaware Code 13, § 8-801 – § 8-810) for any and all IPs regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, and genetic relationship to the child. Parentage is established pre-birth and the statute explicitly provides that the gestational carrier is “not a parent of a child born as a result of a gestational carrier arrangement” so long as specified requirements are met in the arrangement. Hawaii There is no existing statute or case law in Hawaii that prohibits surrogacy so it is freely practiced so long as there is a genetic connection between the intended parents and the child. If the embryo was created with the assistance of an egg or sperm donor, the non-biological parent must complete a second parent adoption either in Hawaii or their home state, in order for the child’s birth certificate to show them both as the parents. For the non-biological parent, parentage can only be established post-birth. However, a hearing for the parentage order typically requires at least the gestational carrier and her spouse, if applicable, to attend in person. Idaho As of July 1, 2023, Idaho Gestational Agreements Act went into effect making Idaho a favorable state for surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection. Under the new law, the parties can file a petition to have their gestational carrier agreement validated pre-birth which in turn makes it enforceable under the statute. Upon finding that the gestational carrier agreement is valid, the court shall issue an order validating the agreement and declaring that the intended parents are/will be the parent(s) of any child born under the terms of the agreement. Then post-birth, the court will issue a validation order and an order of parentage confirming that the intended parents are the parent(s) of the child. Iowa Surrogacy is implicitly permitted in Iowa from a culmination of three legal premises: (1) Iowa Code provides that surrogacy agreements are exempt from Iowa’s law prohibiting the purchase or sale of an individual, (2) Iowa’s administrative code addresses the issuance of birth certificates for children born to a gestational carrier (Iowa Admin. Code r. 641-99.15(144)), and (3) the Iowa Supreme Court held in 2018 that gestational carrier agreements are enforceable and do not violate public policy or the constitutional rights of the gestational carrier or child (P.M. & C.M. v. T.B. & D.B). Furthermore, in the same case, the court stated that gestational carrier agreements “promote families by enabling infertile couples to raise their own children and help bring new life into this world through willing surrogate mothers.”As a result of this, parentage in Iowa is established in two (2) parts. First, parentage is only to be established before birth for the biological father, resulting in a birth certificate listing the biological father with gestational carrier. Then post-birth a second order is necessary to permanently change the child’s birth certificate to list the second parent. This second order is either a parentage order for the other genetic parent or an adoption for a non-genetic parent. Have you thought about becoming a surrogate?

Based on the wants and needs of each party, identifying the right match for the right set of personalities and needs is essential for success.

Screening Our screenings aren’t just a box to tick off, they’re a key stage in our process. We work very hard to ensure surrogates can pass the respective fertility clinic’s criteria; in fact, 95% of our surrogates receive fertility clinic clearance. For surrogates and intended parents alike, the rigor of our screening process helps ensure that your investment of time and emotion is honored and secured. Equally important, matching at ConceiveAbilities is based on understanding the fundamental motivations and context behind the surrogacy arrangement. Who are the people involved? What is their background and their life experiences? What is life at home like? What is their vision for the surrogacy experience? These questions are vital to getting to know each surrogate and each intended parent, so that matches will be compatible. Local Matching Matters™ We know that geographic proximity between intended parents, surrogates and fertility clinics throughout your surrogacy journey might be important to you – for convenience, relationship building and peace of mind. We honor that desire, and because of our reach and popularity in communities across the country, we can address that need. You may find, in your matching process, that factors other than geographic proximity become more important to you. We see great success in both local and long distance surrogacy journeys.

    "content": "By Fran Caruso, Esq. When you embark on a surrogacy journey, you’ll learn all kinds of new medical and legal terminology. Something that you will hear referenced often, from the attorney’s office to the hospital, is the legal parentage process and accompanying legal documents. This process is the critical step whereby parentage is determined – though at what point and in what manner this occurs can vary by state. Depending on where your child is born, the legal parentage process will be completed either pre- or post-birth. What does pre-birth mean? The pre-birth process means that the relevant state law provides an avenue for the parties to present an order to a judge for entry prior to the child being born that establishes the intended parent(s) as the legal parents of the child. It will also likely direct the hospital to release the child to the intended parents after discharge and order the state’s Office of Vital Records to name the intended parents on the child’s birth certificate.What does post-birth mean?The post-birth process is overall procedurally the same as the pre-birth, but it occurs after the child is born. Often this is because the relevant state law contemplates the existence of a live child before anything can be filed or entered. But the ultimate result is the same – a birth certificate with the intended parents’ names and secure legal parentage of the child in favor of the intended parents. What are the legal risks? A common concern amongst intended parents when discussing pre-versus post-birth is whether there is a greater legal risk associated with the post-birth process; i.e., can the gestational carrier decide to keep the baby? In a word, no. ConceiveAbilities will only match intended parents and gestational carriers in a state that supports their respective rights. As the pregnant person, the gestational carrier will have standing to object to the process, whether in a pre- OR a post-birth state. But in either case and what really matters, is that such an objection would be a losing argument. The gestational carrier will have no genetic relationship to the child, there will be a gestational carrier agreement outlining the parties’ rights and responsibilities, and affidavits from doctors and lawyers proving that the intended parents are entitled to legal parentage. Additionally, there will be other documents in place, such as a HIPAA release and power of attorney, ensuring that the intended parents may make all medical decisions for the child and that the child is discharged into their care.On the flip side, a common concern amongst gestational carriers is what happens if the intended parents do not take the baby; do I become responsible? Again, the answer is no. The gestational carrier agreement protects the gestational carrier from any legal or medical responsibility for the child. We encourage you to not focus on whether the legal parentage will occur pre- versus post-birth because, in either circumstance, the intended parents’ legal rights will be secured, and their names will end up on the child’s birth certificate; it is truly a question of when it procedurally occurs. A Final Note on Legal Parentage Every state, whether pre-birth, post-birth, or some amalgamation of the two, has its own unique process and requirements. That is why it is critical to work with an experienced Assisted Reproductive Technology lawyer and agency; you do not want to be some one’s first when it comes to securing parental rights.

    "content": "By Fran Caruso, Esq. A surrogacy contract (also known as a Gestational Carrier Agreement or GCA) is arguably one of the most important documents of the surrogacy journey. Below is a brief overview of the process of drafting the GCA as well as the different terms, rights, and responsibilities that will be contemplated by all parties in the GCA. Drafting the Surrogacy Contract The intended parents and the gestational carrier should each have their own separate independent attorney’s who specialize in reproductive law. Having a separate attorney represent each party ensures a fair and equal representation of both the parties interests. The GCA is drafted by the intended parents’ attorney and includes all of the substantive terms discussed during the matching process. The intended parents will review the agreement with their attorney and then it will be sent to the gestational carrier and her attorney for review. Through their respective attorney’s, the parties will then negotiate the terms of the GCA until all parties have agreed. All parties should expect that there will be some back and forth negotiation of the GCA; this is a good thing and ensures that both parties had adequate representation and understand their rights and responsibilities. Once the terms are agreed to, all parties will execute the GCA and move onto the phase of the journey. Understanding the Contract Topics The GCA exists to protect all parties and ensure everyone understands their rights and responsibilities. Below are some of the terms that will be contemplated in the GCA. Recitals & General Provisions: These sections outline the relevant information about all parties as well as the intent of everyone entering into this agreement. This is essentially a background section that provides critical information as to who, what, where, when, and why. You will also find a numerous defined terms located in this section that provide clarification for the remainder of the GCA. Travel: Provides the details around when and where the gestational carrier can travel during the journey. There will be certain restrictions on travel, both domestic and international, to ensure that the child is born in a surrogacy friendly state. Confidentiality: This section will detail what information may or may not be disclosed regarding the intended parents, gestational carrier, terms of the GCA, and resulting pregnancy. This will also contemplate any future contact between the parties and disclosure to the child that they were born via surrogacy. Medical Considerations: These sections contain some of the most lengthy and sensitive terms including medical screening, testing, undergoing procedures, taking medications, embryo transfer, gestational carrier’s limitations while pregnant, vaccinations, termination or selective reduction, medical emergencies, and facts surrounding delivery of the child. Finances: This will not only detail any financial compensation/reimbursements the gestational carrier is entitled to, but will also detail financial responsibilities for things like insurance, lost wages, bedrest, etc. For a more in-depth breakdown of the cost of surrogacy, read more here. Parentage: The GCA will cite the specific state’s legal authority. It will also detail the process for obtaining the necessary parentage documents to declare the intended parents as the legal parents of the child. It will also contemplate the specific details as to custody and care of the child immediately following birth. Breach & Termination of Agreement: While all parties enter into the GCA hoping and anticipating that there will be no problems, it is essential that the worst-case scenarios are acknowledged and anticipated. Assumption of Risk: Surrogacy and pregnancy are complex matters. All parties need to understand not only their protections, but also the potential risks. “Boiler Plate” Terms: The final part of the GCA will include numerous terms, which are called “boiler plate” terms as they can be found in most contracts, not just surrogacy contracts. These will include things like identification of the respective attorneys, notice requirements, modification procedures, signature specifics, etc. Even though the GCA may not necessarily be the most exciting aspect of the surrogacy, it is extremely important and is critical to confirming all parties are on the same page at the outset of the journey. Take your time in reviewing the GCA and be sure to ask your attorney any and all questions. Learn more about growing your family with surrogacy.

Surrogacy Legal Concepts: Frequently Asked Questions It is important to know the legal landscape for surrogacy so you feel confident and can be a full participant in the process. Here are the answers to some of your common questions:: What is a Gestational Carrier Agreement (“GCA”)? The legal contract between the surrogate and her intended parents, known as the Gestational Carrier Agreement (“GCA”), sits at the heart of your match with intended parents. It’s equally crucial for both surrogate and intended parent alike, so that each parties’ rights and responsibilities to one another are clearly outlined. What is the Legal Gold Standard for Surrogate Rights? Every state has different surrogacy laws and legal precedents. New York recently enacted the Gestational Surrogates’ Bill of Rights, the gold standard of surrogate rights. It ensures gestational surrogates are aware of their rights as they relate to their health and welfare, right to independent legal counsel, health insurance and medical costs, life insurance and contract termination protections. Can intended parents choose not to take the baby? No. The gestational carrier agreement protects the surrogate from any kind of legal or medical responsibility for the child. That said, the concern that the surrogate may become attached to the baby is a common misconception about surrogacy. Listen to our Busting Surrogacy Myths with Dr. Heather Carlson to learn more about surrogacy facts. How is Legal Parentage Established during Surrogacy? A court order ensures that the parentage is properly established. The particulars of how and when the court order occurs vary by state; at ConceiveAbilities, our legal experts guide these activities. A pre-birth order is a court order that establishes the intended parent(s) as the legal parents of the baby. What is the Legal Difference in Types of Surrogacy? First, it’s important to address the different types of surrogacy. While it’s rarely practiced today – and in many states, it’s illegal – traditional (genetic) surrogacy still exists. This means that the surrogate’s own egg is used, making her the child’s genetic mother. It can invite many potential legal and other complications, which is why few intended parents choose this route and is not a type of surrogacy offered by ConceiveAbilities. In the more common gestational surrogacy arrangement, and the arrangement that ConceiveAbilities work with exclusively, the surrogate undergoes In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and carries a child that is genetically related to the intended parents or donor(s). With a proper legal contract in place to protect all parties, gestational surrogacy arrangements are the safest route. Surrogacy laws by state Surrogacy laws vary by state. First and foremost, the surrogate must reside in a state where surrogacy is permitted. In states where surrogacy is specifically prohibited, there may be a risk of criminal and civil penalties, among other risks. Working with a reputable agency like ConceiveAbilities and an attorney who is well versed in surrogacy law is the only way to mitigate these risks; having surrogacy contracts explained protects both the intended parents’ and the surrogate’s rights. Ultimately, recognizing a surrogate’s rights are imperative to a smooth surrogacy journey. We’re here to inform and support you every step of the way.

Paris credits her friend Kim Kardashian to helping her understand surrogacy. ConceiveAbilities Director of Legal Services, Gina-Marie Madow, told DailyMail.com about the influence celebrity has on surrogacy in Everything You Need to Know About Celebrity Surrogacy. She shared that celebrities using surrogacy and sharing their stories had helped normalize it and inspire more women to get involved in the process. “We recently hired [research firm] Accelerant Research to better understand surrogacy. Our research shows almost half of the people surveyed were first exposed to surrogacy through a TV show, or a celebrity surrogacy story like Paris Hilton’s. It also shows that women who have read about or watched celebrity surrogacy journeys are inspired to learn more about becoming a surrogate. Celebrities sharing their surrogacy journeys also normalize the surrogacy process, normalizing the fertility treatment for hopeful parents to grow their families via a surrogate.” On Tuesday, Hilton shared a statement with People about their child, which read: “It’s always been my dream to be a mother and I’m so happy that Carter and I found each other. We are so excited to start our family together and our hearts are exploding with love for our baby boy.” Congratulations, Paris and Carter on your dream come true!

    "content": "As a top fertility doctor at KindBody, Dr. Angie Beltsos has helped thousands of families from all over the world have children using IVF and surrogacy. Sadly, when her daughter Elena didn’t survive, Dr. Beltsos became the patient. She, her husband and her three children decided as a family to partner with a surrogate to complete their own family. This is her surrogacy journey. ConceiveAbilities: How did you choose surrogacy to build your family after suffering a loss? Dr. Angie Beltsos: When some women decide that they’re going to partner with a surrogate, it’s a very sad, and traumatic decision for them to have to make. They might feel guilty or feel like their body has rejected them; some women go through some of this internal turmoil. It’s hard to accept that her baby is going to grow in this other woman. So I think you have to sort of find your way with that, work through some of those feelings and identify what the ideal situation is in picking a surrogate when you’re having some of that internal conflict. Others, such as gay men are very excited because they never thought they’d get to be parents. Now, with opportunities like surrogacy, they can have a family! There’s a lot of different directions and emotions that lead to picking a surrogate. When my husband and I picked our surrogate, it was us surrendering to the process, embracing it and really having fun. Because of my personal experience, I tell people to find the person that you’re going to do this journey with and celebrate what you’re doing together. Watch Dr. Beltsos video share more about her surrogacy journey. ConceiveAbilities: How was your surrogacy journey surprising to your surrogate? Dr. Angie Beltsos: Our surrogate, Jodi and her husband thought they were going to do this altruistic, incredible thing for a couple that does not have children. When they met us, however, we already had three children. We had a fourth child, Elena, who unfortunately didn’t survive. She was born early and we lost her. So Jodi asked us, “What do your kids think of you doing this?” and learned how much our whole family wanted this baby. Most surrogates match with intended parents but, in our story, Jodi matched with our intended family, all of us. ConceiveAbilities: Thinking about this gift Jodi has given your family; how does it make you feel? Dr. Angie Beltsos: We absolutely love Jodi. When our baby was born, her family was in the room afterwards with us holding the baby, loving her. She brought a photographer, so we could take those first day pictures. Our surrogate was just recovering from giving us this most precious gift, so we wanted to celebrate her first day of life together. Jodi’s husband, who is this tough guy in the Army, cried when it was time for us to leave. The people in your life that take care of your child, whether the child is an embryo or toddler, are very invested in the success and the health of the child. It’s magical and it’s important. So don’t be afraid of it, embrace it. You’ll find that that journey becomes even more precious, even many years later. ConceiveAbilities: How has your personal experience through your surrogacy journey helped you help people throughout their own journeys? Dr. Angie Beltsos: You don’t have to have gone through something to be compassionate. There are really incredible doctors that may not have that personal story to add. Empathy, however, when you yourself have gone through it goes a long way. Losing a pregnancy through miscarriage and going through my own surrogate journey provides me a very unique vantage point for my patients. Although I have been trained medically to help care for you, I have also been trained personally. My war wounds and successes have helped me be a better doctor!

    "content": "Sam Mathews felt a calling to become a surrogate and give the gift of family. Sharing every step of their surrogacy journey (the good and the challenging), she and her husband Dan quickly became surrogacy influencers amassing a social following of nearing a million curious people wanting to learn more about the surrogacy process. Sam successfully completed her surrogacy journey in late summer 2022 giving birth to a family’s little boy and continues to share her experience on @wearedanandsam. Sam says using her voice to share the facts about surrogacy and inspire other women to become surrogates is a gift she intends to keep giving. Listen to Nazca Fontes, our CEO and Founder, interview Sam about her experiences as a surrogate, and as a surrogate influencer in the latest edition of All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast. NF: When did you first become interested in the idea of becoming a surrogate? After our youngest daughter Ember, we felt our family was complete. We had a boy and a girl, but I still desired to be pregnant. One day my friend asked me if we were done with our family; I told her yes, but I would love to be pregnant again and asked her, “Is that a weird feeling?” She said “No, you need to become a surrogate.” I had actually thought about it and hadn’t looked into it, so I took this as a sign. It is definitely a calling. I thought if my body is able to carry a pregnancy, then why not help someone else? We get one life on this earth and I want to use it for good. Feeling led to do something and following through with it is such a great feeling. NF: Your husband, Dan, also does content with you. How did you talk to him about your desire to be a surrogate? When I brought it up back in 2018, I reminded him that we were done with our family and that I really liked pregnancy and labor. He said “Yes, I know,” and I asked him his thoughts on me being a surrogate. His first response was, “We’re not giving our baby away.” I told him that was a surrogacy myth and I explained the differences between traditional and gestational surrogacy and that it is not our baby. He did some more research and after about a week of talking about it and praying about it, he was on board! I needed to make sure he understood what he was getting into, because I knew that I would need his support in not only labor, but also throughout the journey. Plus, it’s an emotional journey and I needed his strength for that. Whether one has a spouse or partner, a friend or sibling, having support is so important. NF: How did you decide you wanted to share your journey on TikTok? We were already sharing our life on social media. We were renovating RVs at the time and sharing that life along with motherhood so it just made sense to continue sharing it. We’re very big on sharing the ups and downs, because life isn’t always peaches and cream. I thought how great it would be for us to share our surrogacy journey from matching to delivery and just share the good and the bad, you know, the shots, the appointments, the feelings, the emotions, the excitement, the joy to share it all in hopes that it would be encouraging to someone else. NF: What were some of your most memorable moments during your surrogacy journey? Before this, I would never post myself in my underwear online and I spent my surrogacy journey posting milestones in my Calvin Kleins. I said I would never give myself a shot because I would not be able to handle it. And oh my gosh, I had to do it one night when Dan was away at an event. I went live on TikTok and 800 people were watching me as I did it. I almost passed out, but I did it. I talked about condoms online and how awkward it is buying them and pregnancy tests at the same time while everyone in the store stares at you. Like what are people thinking? In real life, it is always funny when people congratulate you on your pregnancy and you’re like, oh actually it’s not mine. And then they look at my husband and he is like, it’s not mine either and then everyone is just confused! NF: We love busting surrogacy myths. What were surrogacy misconceptions you heard? A lot of people asked, “How can you give a baby away?” And then we explained the baby was not genetically related to me. People were curious on how transfer worked and to be honest, when we first pursued surrogacy, I didn’t know. And so explaining how IVF works is helpful; others need to know that the pregnancy occurs through a catheter in a clinic, overseen by a doctor, to understand the surrogacy process. People were also curious on how the transition would go with handing the baby over. Would I be sad about not bringing home a baby for ourselves (no, it’s not our baby) or if the husband would be in the delivery room (yes he was). There are so many different questions about surrogacy because it’s not widely talked about. NF: What was the moment of delivery like as a surrogate? That moment when they held their baby and seeing their eyes filled with so much joy and gratitude and thankfulness was such a memorable experience. I turned to my husband and said, “We did it. WE did it!” And I’m so thankful we got it on camera to document our journey coming to completion. In that moment, we did what we set out to do, what we vowed to do, what we agreed to do for this couple. We brought them their healthy baby boy and I’m so thankful for that. NF: What would you tell someone who feels called to become a surrogate? If you feel called to be a surrogate, don’t be discouraged by what you think will disqualify you. Get your medical records reviewed by a doctor to determine if you would qualify to be a surrogate. Some people think they can’t become a surrogate if they have had a miscarriage or their tubes tied. I learned you don’t actually have to have your tubes, because the baby is placed inside your uterus. Don’t let the fear of being disqualified stop you from trying. There are so many intended parents out there that are waiting for their miracle, for someone to help them create a family. You could be the one that completes their family, so just look into it. NF: You’ve completed a journey successfully and brought so much joy to your intended parents. You’ve set out in this great adventure with your husband and family in an RV while homeschooling your kids. What’s next? Everyone wants to know if we are going to do another journey! I wish sometimes that I was Oprah and say, “You can get a baby, you get a baby, you get a baby.” When we first started looking into surrogacy, we did not set out to do multiple journeys. We have loved sharing our life and inspiring so many people and because the journey went so, well, why not do it again? Right now, we’re just waiting on the timing of it; maybe you’ll see another journey in the future. Read the full blog about Sam’s Surrogacy journey on our Medium.com surrogacy blog!

    "content": "The decision to pump breast milk is a shared decision between a surrogate and her intended parents, with some surrogates opting not to pump, others pumping briefly, and some providing milk for an extended period. It’s important to note that exclusively pumping for donation differs from pumping for your own child, so ensuring it works for both you and the intended family is essential. If you choose to pump, it’s crucial to know how to maintain and increase your milk supply. Regular pumping, staying hydrated, and proper nutrition are key strategies. Additionally, ensuring the breast pump is high-quality and fits well can significantly impact your ability to maintain and increase your milk supply. Whether or not you decide to pump, the choice should align with both your needs and those of your intended parents. What is surrogate milk donation? After giving birth, the surrogate may choose to extend their surrogacy journey and pump breast milk for the surrobabe. This is a common part of the surrogacy process and can range from the first part of the child’s life and some even extend the amount of time they pump for their Intended Family. Some parents know they would like to have a surrogate pump before their surrogacy journey begins, while others make the decision during the surrogacy process, or choose not to have the surrogate pump for them. Any agreement the surrogate and intended family makes will be included, or amended, in the surrogacy agreement. If the Intended Parents do not wish for the surrogate to pump, she can donate her breast milk to a milk bank or she may choose to suppress lactation, more commonly known as drying up her milk supply. Do you have to pump for your intended family? As part of our Matching Matters process, ConceiveAbilities matching experts will ask you whether you intend to pump and this topic will be addressed during the initial match meeting with your IPs. Although you may be asked about your thoughts on pumping, you do not need to make the choice early in the process and can wait until you are further in your surrogacy journey to make your final decision. Pumping after delivery is not a requirement for surrogates, nor is it an expectation. If your intended parents want to feed their baby breast milk and you are either unable or choose not to provide it, ConceiveAbilities staff will help them to explore other options, such as milk banks. If you do decide to pump or donate your milk after your surrogacy journey, lactation expert Lenna Gregory of Mother’s Milk Bank has some pro pumping, shipping and donating tips. If you are undecided on whether or not you want to pump, here is a short list of pros and cons to help you sort out whether pumping as a surrogate is right for you. Pros of Pumping As a Gestational Surrogate 1) Surrogacy Pumping Community Already Exists Although the idea of pumping as a surrogate may be new to you, there are many women who have been sharing their ideas and providing support for one another for many years. A quick Google search results in dozens of online resources and communities that are all devoted to pumping surrogates. These networks like La Leche League are a rich resource capable of providing you with both practical insight and inspiration. We especially recommend checking out this Pumping After A Surrogacy Pregnancy Facebook group. There are also great resources and lactation experts like Balanced Beginnings to help you navigate your pumping journey. 2) Pumping Is Good for your Health Pumping promotes nearly all of the healing and health benefits that breastfeeding does. Specifically, pumping will help with your fourth trimester recovery by shrinking your uterus, burning extra calories, and helping reduce uterine bleeding after birth. Plus, pumping releases oxytocin, a powerful hormone linked to love, trust, and pair bonding. All of this leads to great outcomes for your health including Increasing calorie burn Reducing the mother’s risk of breast and ovarian cancer Reducing type 2 diabetes Reducing high blood pressureHere is a great resource from America College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists about how to prepare to pump after giving birth. 3) Breast Milk is Liquid Gold Breast Milk is full of antibodies that help babies to fight off viruses and bacteria. The milk you provide will help bolster your surrobaby’s immunity and decrease episodes of diarrheal illness, ear infections, severe lower respiratory tract infections, diabetes, obesity, and sudden infant death syndrome. No wonder the American Academy of Pediatrics considers breastmilk the most ‘optimal form of nutrition’ for infants. Read more about breastfeeding benefits! Complete nutrition for infant Antibodies that build strong immune system Protection from diseases like diabetes type 1, asthma and sudden infant death syndrome Learn more tips on how to maintain and increase your milk supply from lactation expert Nikki Bredeson. 4) Pumping is Easier than Ever Some insurance companies, and possibly your intended parents, will cover the cost of your breast pump and lactation counselor. There is a lot of pumping equipment on the market, so choose the best pump for you. There are some very innovative, new products on the market that makes pumping easier than ever like The Willow™ Pump, which was the first wearable breast pump that fits in your bra with no external tubes, cords, or dangling bottles to hold you back. You can pump while vacuuming, shopping at Target, you name it! There are also inventive products like Freeze It Flat by Mammaway and Milkify, which freeze dries breast milk. 5) Pumping Compensation One of our most frequently asked surrogate questions is, “If I choose to pump for my intended family, will I be compensated?” The answer is yes, you will receive additional compensation in addition to the rest of your surrogate pay. Although compensation is likely not one of your primary motivations, you will be compensated by your intended parent(s) for extending your surrogacy journey and that will be included in your mutually agreed upon gestational carrier agreement. This is in addition to your All-In Surrogate Care & Compensation Package. 6) You Can Donate Your Milk And Make A Difference Many of our surrogates have questions about donating breast milk after their surrogacy pregnancy, in addition to pumping for their surrobabe. Donating human milk can have a life-saving impact for babies born everyday. In the United States, 450,000 babies are born prematurely every year, and others struggle with serious illness. These fragile babies will survive and thrive thanks to the generosity of human milk donors who give the critical nourishment they need. Just one ounce of breast milk can feed a baby in a neonatal intensive care unit for an entire day. Read more about how to donate your milk. While there are so many pros to pumping for your surrobaby, there are reasons why pumping may not be the right choice for you. Cons of Pumping As a Gestational Surrogate 1) Timing: Pumping is Hard Work Although it is easier now than ever, exclusively pumping can take some work and it may still cause multiple interruptions to your daily and nightly schedule. For some busy mamas, fitting this additional task into their schedules is just not a possibility. 2) Shipping Milk is Tricky Shipping to Intended Parents who are not local may be extra work to both pump your breast milk and also ship it. Since breast milk is perishable, you will have to follow some strict instructions to assure that it arrives fit for consumption. You and your Intended Family will make the shared decision on how often your ship. Make certain you and your Intended Parents have discussed not only compensation for breast milk but also reimbursement for costs associated with shipping as you may be surprised how expensive it is to ship a week’s worth of milk cross-country. Watch this video featuring lactation expert Lenna Gregory on how to pump, ship or donate your breast milk after your surrogacy pregnancy delivery. 3) Uninterested Intended Parents Some intended parents may not want to have their surrogate pump. If you find yourself in this situation, willing and wanting to pump, your Match Manager can try to find you another intended family that wants donor breast milk or you can consider donating your milk to a milk bank. With the infant baby formula shortage and lasting effects of the pandemic, milk banks urgently need replenishing. Many hospitals also are interested in donated breast milk for premature babies.

We’d only been married for 8 years when I started my first surrogacy journey. We have two children, a 26 year old daughter and an 18 year old son. I love to travel, be on the water, and am always looking to try something new! KRISTINA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY When my son was in kindergarten, one of his classmate’s mother was a surrogate. She was the first surrogate I had ever met, so initially I turned to her with a few questions and for more information. While I knew what a surrogate was, I had never met one before. At this time, I was nearing the maximum age to become a surrogate. Although I was in the process of furthering my education, things at home were pretty stable as was my job as a labor and delivery nurse. I decided to apply and see what became of it. I am so glad that I did! WHAT MAKES KRISTINA COURAGEOUS Most people in my life have had nothing but the kindest things to say about what I have done. However, my father initially did not understand what would compel me to become a surrogate. Interestingly enough, by the time I was carrying for my second and third sets of intended parents, it was this same man who couldn’t not tell anyone he met about what I was doing fast enough! He sure was proud of the gift I was giving these families, and I think that watching everything unfold throughout my first journey helped him understand the magnitude of this gift. KRISTINA’S PURPOSE: Hands down, the most rewarding part of my surrogacies has been watching my intended parents see a child they dreamed about enter the world. It truly brings the initial aspect of a journey full circle. The friendship and updates I get from these families I helped create has been equally rewarding. Inspired by Kristina?

I am a small business consultant, my husband is a financial advisor, and my kids are involved in dance, gymnastics, soccer, and softball. KRISTIN’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I couldn’t imagine not being a mother, and if I could help another couple have the child they so badly wanted, I figured why not? My husband and I had already completed our family, so we moved forward with the application process. I was matched with a wonderful couple from my home state, and since I no longer live there, this made our connection special! I had a little girl for them and we still keep in close contact. I am very grateful to ConceiveAbilities for matching me with this amazing family! WHAT MAKES KRISTIN COURAGEOUS If you’re considering becoming a surrogate, make sure you and your partner/support system are 100% sure that this is the right time for you. Be prepared for more than a 9 month commitment. My journey started in 2018 and I delivered in 2020. I also pumped afterwards, so all in all, it was about 3 years. It is beyond worth it, but it is a commitment and you will need/want support. KRISTIN’S PURPOSE The feeling I experienced is not something you can really describe. Having the ability to help a family grow while having the support that I had from my loved ones is just incredible! The BEST part of the entire journey was seeing the look on the intended parents’ faces when their daughter was born. Bringing a life into the world is an amazing feeling. Inspired by Kristin?

I’m Kristi, and I’m an Early Childhood Education teacher currently living in Denver with my daughter, McKenzie, and working as a full-time nanny. My favorite hobbies include crafting, cooking, and gardening. On the weekends, my daughter and I love to get out of the house and check out local activities around town, like farmers markets, hiking, and visiting the bookstore. KRISTI’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I have always loved kids! My background is in early childhood development and I worked in the classroom with infants and toddlers and was always around children, babysitting and nannying, from a young age. I worked with parents as well, and sometimes they were older parents. I often heard stories about fertility issues, which inspired me to become a surrogate. My heart really wanted me to do this for a family in need, and I decided to answer the call! WHAT MAKES KRISTI COURAGEOUS As a single mom, I was finally able to fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming a surrogate. My daughter is 11 years old and was amazing through the whole process. She loved telling people “this baby is not coming home with us” and was happy to maintain her status as an only child. Being a surrogate truly allowed me to enjoy every aspect of the pregnancy. KRISTI’S PURPOSE: My purpose has always been to help others who have a strong desire to become parents. I felt like I have been “called” to be a surrogate. At the end of my journey, the moment the baby was delivered, tears of pure joy ran down my face! The joy of seeing her parents getting to hold their baby for the first time. That moment was exactly why I wanted to be a surrogate! Read more about Kristi’s surrogacy journey on Mile High Mamas: How To Become A Surrogate In Denver. Inspired by Kristi?

We have two children, Carter and Arie. We love bike rides, family game nights, and the Chicago Bulls! HANNAH’S CALLING TO SURROGACY The family I worked for throughout college had twins via a surrogate, which was something I found beautiful and fascinating. Once we had our own kids, I knew that I wanted to become a surrogate, myself. Having had two relatively easy pregnancies and labor/deliveries, and knowing so many people who either had negative experiences or had fertility issues, I knew I had to do it. WHAT MAKES HANNAH COURAGEOUS I applied to be a ConceiveAbilities surrogate in January 2019, was matched in March, and had my transfer in December. At about 16 weeks, COVID-19 shut down everything in Chicago. I stayed in touch with the intended family through Face Time, and they came a few weeks before the due date, We visited with them and their 2-year-old daughter until the baby was born in August 2020. She is absolutely amazing! HANNAH’S PURPOSE Honestly, I love the feeling of being pregnant, and to know that I can do that while also providing someone with the gift of family is like a completely blissful win-win situation for me! Becoming a surrogate changed my life because I’ve been able to spread awareness of surrogacyas an option for having a family. Most of my family and friends had not heard much about surrogacy or had preconceived ideas about what it entails, and I was able to share my experience and help the people around me gain a better understanding of the process.

I own and operate my own custom cake company, The Cake Box Miami. I documented my surrogacy journey in Miami, Florida on my Instagram Surrogacy Diaries. ANDREA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I can’t remember a time when I didn’t think about being a surrogate. It has always been something that was placed in my heart! Looking back, my mom always instilled helping others into our lives growing up, and I definitely think that made a big impact on my decision. My aunt also almost became a surrogate when I was younger, so that might have planted that first seed. WHAT MAKES ANDREA COURAGEOUS I was most anxious about meeting my IP’s in person. Even though we had met via Zoom and had emailed for several months before the transfer, you just never know! They are amazing. I was also really nervous about the injections, but, they really weren’t all that bad.

I work outside the home at a local non-profit, although since COVID I’ve been lucky enough to work remotely. My family and I enjoy hiking, the outdoors, adventures and family time. TOBI’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I wanted to become a surrogate ever since the birth of my oldest son. Being able to be part of that moment of giving someone their child was something that really spoke to me. I was lucky enough to have easy pregnancies and deliveries with my own children, so I thought, why not?! After the birth of our youngest son, we knew that our family was complete. After I finished nursing him, I was certain the time was right to pursue surrogacy! WHAT MAKES TOBI COURAGEOUS After signing up with ConceiveAbilities, I was matched pretty quickly with a couple just a few states away. This was all right when COVID lock downs began, so it was a crazy time! I drove down to the clinic in New Jersey for my medical work up, and we had our first embryo transfer September 2020. It was successful, although we unfortunately had an early miscarriage discovered at our 8 week monitoring appointment. After a long few months getting back my body back on track after the D&C, we had our second transfer March 2021. I am now 26 weeks pregnant with my IPs baby girl! TOBI’S PURPOSE Pushing through uncertainty and the difficult moments that occurred throughout the IVF process and the first half of the pregnancy was tough. We had a bumpy road, so persevering through that to get where we are today is very rewarding. I now know all the sacrifices I made were worthwhile! Inspired by Tobi?

I’m a Licensed Professional Counselor and I was able to complete two life changing journeys for two amazing families. TISHA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I have known what surrogacy was even before starting my own family, however it truly became a dream of mine after my son was born. My sister-in-law was having difficulty becoming pregnant, which hurt me deeply. I knew in my heart that surrogacy was my next step to help another family. Before embarking on this journey, I had never met another woman who had been a surrogate. What I did know was that I had a wonderful pregnancy with my son and myself, plus my husband, were 100% all in for a surrogacy journey! WHAT MAKES TISHA COURAGEOUS Maybe it was excitement, joy, or unknowns; but I didn’t have many fears. I was most nervous about the hormones/medications, however when I am ready for something I jump in feet first, which is what I did with my first and second journey. I look at life as having purpose and meaning so any fears/anxieties about the journey were over-arched by the purpose I felt. Since my first journey was over 9 years ago, my friends and family had questions, since surrogacy wasn’t as prevalent back then as it is now. However, everyone was very supportive of my decision to help others. TISHA’S PURPOSE: Surrogacy became my passion and led me to begin working with ConceiveAbilities. I have been able to utilize my background as a licensed counselor and previous surrogacies to now help many other families/surrogates. Inspired by Tisha?

We’ve been married for 16 years and have two teenage daughters, ages 12 and 14. Even though we live in the suburbs, we often joke that we live “on the farm,” as we have 2 ducks, 6 chickens and a long list of other pets! PAULA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I’ve been a gestational carrier three times now. However, the first time I thought about trying to help another family have a child was in 2009. It was not one specific person who inspired me, rather a collection of stories that I heard from other moms I knew through a mom’s group I belonged to. Through their stories and the stories of couples close to them who struggled with infertility, I was inspired to look into the surrogacy process. WHAT MAKES PAULA COURAGEOUS Initially, I was most anxious about not knowing how long the process would take. However, that was quickly explained by ConceiveAbilities and the IVF clinic. My husband was extremely supportive and excited about the process from the beginning. My friends and family thought it was strange at first, but were quick to share in my excitement once they learned more. My husband was my biggest and constant support. He listened to me when needed, cared for the house and children, and understood why being a surrogate was important to me. I was surprised by how extremely fulfilled I felt after the delivery of the first baby. Even though I anticipated that the journey would be rewarding, nothing could prepare me for how life changing the delivery was and how I would want to continue to help other families after that. PAULA’S PURPOSE: Being a surrogate has changed my life in many ways. It gave me a new appreciation for my own children and husband, humbled me to realize how challenging it is for some intended parents to have a child/children, and it gave me the opportunity to work in this field helping others to build their families.

I’m 35 years old and am a real estate agent in the Atlanta area who loves to travel, be outside, exercise, and eat good food. I have three children; Levi, Reeves and my only daughter, Londyn. I had my first surrobaby in May of 2018, and he lives in New York City with his mom, dad, and big sister. LORIAHN’S CALLING TO SURROGACY Several years ago, a friend of mine was a ConceiveAbilities surrogate who shared her journey online. This was actually the first time I had ever heard about surrogacy! Since I’d had three easy pregnancies, I knew I wanted to research it more. It’s always been a life goal of mine to find a way to help someone in a way that couldn’t help themselves, and surrogacy seemed like an amazing way to do that. In March 2017, I was matched with my first intended family and immediately knew they were the right couple for me. We had a successful natural cycle transfer that September, and I delivered their healthy baby boy in May 2018. I was matched with my second amazing intended family in March 2021, and we had our transfer in September 2021. In fact, I actually just got a great beta number to let me know this transfer was successful as well! WHAT MAKES LORIAHN COURAGEOUS My partner has been amazing… giving me shots and meds and just in general being very supportive of my desire to do this again. My family and friends have been incredibly happy for me and the families I have helped. They all think it’s just the most generous thing, and while I agree that it is generous, I also just feel so blessed and honored that I’m able to help a family have a baby. LORIAHN’S PURPOSE The most rewarding part of my journey was the moment the parents got to meet their baby for the first time. It was emotional and sweet and the happiest day for everyone involved! Also, getting the privilege to watch this little baby become a toddler, and then a big kid, and just knowing that you helped this little person have this beautiful life.

My husband is in the Air Force, and we honestly never expected to get stationed here, so it was quite a surprise! Alaska is beautiful, and we fully enjoy the 22 hours of sunlight in the summer when you will find us salmon fishing, hiking, camping, and tending our overwhelming garden. In the winter we enjoy downhill and cross-country skiing. In my free time, I love reading, traveling, and doing hot yoga! LACI’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I was introduced to surrogacy during my first pregnancy. Before I became pregnant, my husband and I had gotten married thinking that children may not be in our future. Our first pregnancy was such a surprise, and quite emotional as we had been mentally preparing for this day to never happen. When I heard about surrogacy, I developed a deep kinship with the idea as I knew what it felt like to not have children. Now that I was able to have children, I knew I had to help other women who could not! WHAT MAKES LACI COURAGEOUS I was most anxious about causing my intended parents more pain. By the time most intended parents come to surrogacy, they have suffered loss, or the pain of not being able to conceive – The last thing I wanted was for this pregnancy to not work out. I quickly realized that I was worrying about the uncontrollable, and we just took it day by day. Once we hit 12 weeks gestation, we were able to relax and enjoy the pregnancy, and dream about the delivery day! LACI’S PURPOSE: The most amazing moment was when my intended parents were handed their baby. The emotion that overtook the room was deeply moving and made every shot, appointment, and pregnancy pain worth it! Additionally, our continued friendship with them has been so rewarding.

I have a few friends who have been surrogates in the past, so when surrogacy finally became legal in our state in 2019, I started the surrogate application process. When it came time to meet our potential match, we talked on Zoom for hours! By the time we were ready to hang up, we had all already agreed that we wanted to move forward with starting this journey together! WHAT MAKES SARAH COURAGEOUS At first, my husband didn’t know much about surrogacy, so he did research and was supportive of my decision. My mom and siblings were happy that I was able to do this for someone, and my friends thought it was so wonderful! As a mother myself, I couldn’t imagine not being able to have a family of my own, so I wanted to help someone become a parent and grow their own little family. SARAH’S PURPOSE: I am so thankful to have done this for my intended parents. Being a surrogate for a family in need is such a unique experience – I helped them have a child of their own! Not only are you helping the parents, but you may be giving someone a grandchild or sibling or cousin. I feel so blessed to have been able to do this for them! The parents tell me they are thankful for me every single day. If you want to help a family out, have the time and are healthy enough to become a surrogate, go for it! It is such a rewarding experience for everyone involved. Inspired by Sarah? Calling All Surrogates Are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy?

My husband Rolando and I have been married since 2008, and our son Benjamin completed our family in 2012. Benjamin keeps us busy with karate, soccer, choir, and chess club. We recently rescued two cats and they have brought a lot of laughs into our home. ROBYN’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I initially applied to be a ConceiveAbilities egg donor before switching paths to surrogacy, and I’m so happy I did! Having now been a two-time surrogate, I have so much to be proud of and so many happy memories to look back on. I matched with my first couple in March 2013, we successfully transferred in November, and a healthy boy was delivered in July 2014. It didn’t take very long for me to decide on a second journey, and I matched with another family in May 2015. I safely delivered in June 2016. Becoming a surrogate opened my eyes to the realities of infertility that I’d never really been exposed to in my life. WHAT MAKES ROBYN COURAGEOUS It’s been over five years since my surrogacy journey, and I feel like my heart has been telling me to do this one last time for a while now. I’m very hopeful for a third journey! ROBYN’S PURPOSE: What could be more rewarding than seeing the look of absolute awe and love on new parents’ faces? Not only was I lucky enough to help complete two families, but realizing that you’re making parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles… the impact of these journeys is deeper than we initially imagine.

We recently relocated from Florida to Northeast Georgia for my husband’s job and for a fresh start. MICHELLE’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I came across an article in People magazine about a surrogacy agency which got me really interested in surrogacy, so I started researching more about other surrogates. I read a lot of stories from the perspective of the intended parent, and realized how difficult it must be to want to have a baby so badly when your body just won’t cooperate. This really got me thinking – I had two very easy pregnancies and thought I could easily do it again for someone else! My husband and I talked and agreed that it would be an amazing thing to do for a family. That’s when I came across ConceiveAbilities and reached out to find out more about the surrogacy process. I was eventually matched with a wonderful family from New Jersey and we connected almost right away. WHAT MAKES MICHELLE COURAGEOUS When we moved to Georgia, I became a stay at home mom. My older son was in kindergarten and my younger son was going to be starting school the following year. Knowing that they would be more independent and out of the diaper, bottle, toddler stages helped make the decision easy. I thought, “what better time to start this journey?” Becoming a surrogate has helped give me a sense of purpose and a feeling of being grateful for what I have in my own life. MICHELLE’S PURPOSE The most rewarding part of this experience has been getting to know the intended mother. She is such a sweet person and she sends me cards and little gifts all the time to let me know how grateful she is to have me. It makes me feel so good inside that I can help her!

I’m Ashtin, I currently live in Indiana with my amazing husband of 11 years, Jeff, and our three beautiful kids, two boys (Masen and Brooks) and a girl (Gracie) and we can’t forget Winston, our french bulldog. I’m a two-time surrogate (sibling journey) to Silas and Sloane. ASHTIN’S CALLING TO SURROGACY Being a surrogate has always been on my mind. My husband and I started dating in high school and got married just after college; I remember a few conversations where we spoke about helping another family have children once our family was complete. Even then, without knowing anything about surrogacy, he never questioned me. About a year after we decided our family was complete, a childhood friend came back into my life. She was on her first journey carrying a beautiful little boy for the most deserving dads-to-be. I knew in my heart I was ready. The rest was history, I applied in March 2018, delivered the most perfect little boy March 17, 2019, and completed Brian and Scott’s family on June 4th, 2020, with their sweet little girl. WHAT MAKES ASHTIN COURAGEOUS I never questioned being able to detach myself from the pregnancy. I knew from the second I met Brian and Scott, it was about them. I was always focused on them, every little milestone was always for them. I think that potential surrogates are already aware and open if they come into the process – and being a little nervous is normal. My comfort was my relationship with my intended dads. That connection was my drive. ASHTIN’S PURPOSE: I honestly feel like the lucky one. There isn’t a day that passes that I don’t think about Brian, Scott, Silas and Sloane. Being a surrogate has taught me more about myself than I thought possible. I’ve not only changed my life, but I believe I’ve opened the eyes of others. I made a difference. My passion and purpose is to be a mother, and now I can add being a surrogate. I found something bigger than myself. We all gained something beautiful when surrogacy brought us together!

Originally from Upstate New York, I moved to Maui, Hawaii where I met my husband, Nick. Eventually we settled in Minnesota, where Nick was born and raised, with our only son, Jack. AMANDA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY My surrogate journey started right after I had Jack. After his birth, my love for him was overwhelming and I felt every person wanting children should get to feel this! I heard about surrogacy on a podcast I was listening to, and decided to look into it – I was hooked! I applied and was surprised about how fast things moved along. Becoming a surrogate felt like a purpose and destiny for me. I knew it was the right time because our son was young and we didn’t plan on having any more children of our own. WHAT MAKES AMANDA COURAGEOUS My husband was so supportive of my dreams. My friends were also there for me and thought it was a selfless gift I was giving to someone. At first, my family was concerned and didn’t understand, until I explained it wasn’t genetically my baby – Then they were on board and supported me 100 percent! My advice to someone wanting to be a surrogate is to be patient and let things happen as they should. My first journey took 3 years due to failed transfers and waiting for the parents to make new embryos. It all worked out in the end, but it did take patience.

    "content": "Pregnancy and Chiropractic Care Can chiropractic care help during pregnancy? Dr. Jo Nell Shaw, a chiropractor and naturopathic doctor at Shaw Family Practice in Fort Collins, Colorado, believes the world needs healthy moms, and she is on a mission to improve the experience of being a woman in the modern world. Dr. Shaw shared how going to the chiropractor can benefit pregnancy, delivery and fourth trimester postpartum recovery after a surrogacy journey. Whether you are just thinking about becoming a surrogate, pregnant, or in your fourth trimester recovery, your health is important. Our All In Surrogate Care & Compensation Package includes partum care from the beginning all the way through your fourth trimester, including information on how to take care of your body pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy and postpartum. Can you explain what a chiropractor is? A chiropractor is somebody who looks at the nervous system and a person’s spinal integrity. We look at the joints of the body, the joints of the head, and the spine. They’ll make sure that they’re all aligned and that your nervous system is functioning well. That’s important to the connection between the brain and body. When a joint is not moving well, you’re going to feel pain and there’s going to be muscle tension around it. Your brain is constantly getting feedback that the body is not where you think it is. You need to fix it. We do have that very gentle touch. It’s not like the YouTube videos that you’ll see on chiropractors where they’re just popping everything. The whole idea of bone cracking is a myth. We are not cracking bones, we are moving joints. What is a naturopathic doctor? A naturopathic physician, or naturopathic doctor, is somebody who basically uses nature and the laws of nature to change someone’s physiology. We’re looking at people as a whole ecosystem. So it’s not just all of the organ systems of your body, but it’s also the environment that you’ve been in, any exposures that you’ve had from environmental toxins or genetic discrepancies. We also look a lot at people’s experience of the world, including any kind of trauma or events that have happened to them. We start basically peeling back the layers to figure out what the actual cause is of a particular health issue. What are some of the main benefits of someone going to a chiropractor doctor like you? Often people will seek out chiropractors because they are in pain, although we do a lot more than just relieving pain. Anytime that your body alignment is not correct, you may actually start seeing other systems in your body start to communicate, telling you they’re not doing well either. That’s not always painful. For instance, if somebody has sluggish digestion or constipation, I can address that. We’re looking at the body and how it’s adapting to all of the information that it’s giving the brain and, in return, how the brain is sending that back and changing the function of organs, muscles and joints. Your mission is to improve the experience of being a woman in the modern world. How do you do that through chiropractic care? I find that many women are trying to do everything for everyone around them. In order to make their life better, I demonstrate that taking time to focus on themselves is essential. It starts to empower them and put them in a role where they’re not putting themselves on the back burner and letting their health deteriorate. I see that a lot with women who end up having auto-immune conditions. Oftentimes, when we start peeling back the layers, they will then say, “Wow, I really wish I would’ve seen a chiropractor sooner because I would have really changed the way I was living my life.” You can imagine how running ragged for a really long time will cause these women’s health to really start hurting. This doesn’t affect just them, but everyone around them because they can’t show up and be fully present with their kids or their spouse. They’re missing days of work because they are in pain, and now they have a health crisis that they feel came out of nowhere. When we ask, “When did it start?”, they realize it has been going on for over a decade and felt it was just not a big enough issue to do anything about it at that time. What pregnancy issues can chiropractic care help solve? A major one is breech pregnancies. Chiropractic care helps by actually changing the mom’s anatomy. If you think about the natural curvature of someone’s spine, pregnant women end up having a large mass, the baby, in front of them. This causes their spine and back to really curve. Posture changes as the weight of the baby keeps increasing, and the body has to stretch and change with that. If she doesn’t have really good alignment, it’s not going to stretch and change optimally; compensations will occur which end up creating hip and shoulder pain. There are ligaments that go from the tailbone to the uterus. If your tailbone is not in good alignment, your uterus gets a bit twisted. It’s like a hot air balloon, with ropes on it; if one of those ropes is tighter, that hot air balloon is going to bend differently than if they were both symmetrical side to side. Women with asymmetries run the risk of having a harder delivery, worse birth outcomes and a harder postpartum recovery. What is the Webster technique? The Webster technique is a chiropractic technique geared towards helping pelvic anatomy for pregnant women. We want those ligaments going from the tailbone up to the uterus to be very symmetrical and stable. We balance out the piriformis muscles that run across your butt cheeks. We work on the front of the belly. Some women, later in pregnancy, will start having round ligament pain. That ligament is unique in that it actually has a muscle fiber running through it. It can have a trigger point in it that causes a lot of pain similar to what you get in your upper back. The Webster technique is focused on a pregnant woman and all about improving her anatomy to create the best environment for the baby to be in. Not every chiropractor is trained in pregnancy, so I encourage women to turn to resources like the International Chiropractic Pediatric Associationto find Webster certified chiropractors. What exercises do you recommend pregnant women do throughout their pregnancy? I teach women what are called rest smart postures. These are ways to, for instance, sit in chairs or to move from lying down to sitting up in a way that doesn’t hurt your alignment. By utilizing these postures, women help to prevent pressure in the abdomen and reduce the chances of diastasis recti, which is a condition where the abdominal muscles separate. Not only do these postures help women recover faster from pregnancy, they help women to be more comfortable during that nine to 10 months of gestation. I also encourage pregnant women to do assisted squats. For example, doing a goddess squat stretches the perineum and helps to ensure that the legs are building endurance. Chiropractic care can help that and make the delivery go much more effectively! How can a surrogate’s partner help? I show partners techniques so that they can help women really feel comfortable throughout pregnancy and delivery. There’s one technique that I’ll have partners learn to help women when she wakes up in the middle of the night with hip pain, which helps everybody get a better night’s sleep. That same technique can be used later on during delivery, by opening up the pelvic outlet, contractions are more effective and the baby can come out easier. How do you use chiropractic care for surrogates? Going through pregnancy with the intention that you are growing a baby lovingly and giving that to the intended parents is amazing. Pregnancy is still challenging for a surrogate’s body and having a strong connection to her own anatomy is incredibly important. When I talk to these women about their experiences, they’ll tell me it was one of the greatest gifts that they could ever give someone. I want to make sure that their pregnancies and healing go as amazing as possible because I want that gift to continue to be something that they can cherish. How does a chiropractor help the surrogate and her family? We want to be able to make sure that surrogates can adapt to their changing bodies. They still have a family that they have to take care of, on top of caring for themselves. I work with women to give them the energy that they need while growing the baby. Our nervous system is going to be key in managing any kind of stress and chiropractic care helps ensure the brain and body are connected and working well together. When a surrogate has little ones at home that she’s taking care of while pregnant, if she’s uncomfortable she’s going to be grumpier because pregnancy can be such a drain on women. When a surrogate is comfortable, that is a huge gift and hopefully she is thinking, “Oh my gosh, this is the best pregnancy I’ve ever had!” That is the feedback that I get often and I want that for every surrogate. Do you have advice for the surrogates who are preparing for birth? Look at some rest smart positions. When you’re sitting down, you want your sitz bones, the deep bones in your pelvic outlet, to be on the surface and your feet are going to be wide and angled out. You want your belly to drop in between your legs to allow the gravity and weight of the baby to help stretch your muscles. Also, move often and eat as many vegetables as you can. Fiber is going to keep things really comfortable. As long as your digestion is doing well, you’ll be able to get anything that’s being mobilized out of your body. If your body doesn’t move with ease, find a chiropractor that can help. Consider yoga, too; there are plenty of free pregnancy based yoga programs on YouTube! Does a chiropractor have any benefit for intended parents as well? If an infant is uncomfortable and if they have problems pooping, feeding, or sleeping, those are all indications that a chiropractor can be helpful. Babies have had a stressful event during the birthing process, which impacts their entire body. If a baby is more comfortable, they’re going to feed better, poop with ease and sleep better too! I always tell parents to look at their children to see if their face is symmetrical. If you see one eye too small or closed, that’s going to be an indication that there’s something happening in the head shape that we can change. Also, look for a head tilt. That often can change the way that your child interprets the world. It’s also important that their mouth is opening and closing while feeding. If they’re uncomfortable trying to suck on anything, that’s another indication that a chiropractor could be helpful in getting their palate and their skull structure accustomed to being outside of a body. What role does a chiropractor have in the 4th trimester postpartum time? Fourth trimester postpartum care for surrogates does look different. Helping these women to feel at home again in their bodies while recovering from pregnancy is the goal. We address any complications from pregnancy, whether there was tearing, pain, or separation of abdominal muscles. All of her organs had to shift while she was pregnant and now they have to shift back. We work with that organ anatomy. I want to make sure that women are feeling their life is going the way that they intended. If a woman is struggling with pain, fatigue, or feelings of unworthiness, that’s something that I’m trained to help with. Having care providers who can address those needs is essential. If they’re in Colorado, they can come and work with me. If not, I can help put them in touch with people in their area. I really want to make sure that every woman is able to live the life that they want and feel good in their bodies. What is your advice for women who are considering becoming a surrogate? If you love being pregnant, I would definitely investigate. Talk to other surrogates to learn about their experience. The conversations that I’ve had have been extremely valuable because these women have said how much they loved it and how it was such a gift that they would do it again. On a clinical note, I know that a lot of women say they feel best when pregnant and that’s awesome. Somebody who truly enjoys that experience of being pregnant can be a great surrogate. Being a surrogate can be hard, so make sure that you have a community around you who understands your choices! When making this decision, think about the risks, the benefits, and the alternatives. Make sure that this is the best choice for you and your family and then there will be no regrets. You can listen to other people, but tap into yourself and really use that as a guide to decide what would be best for you and your immediate family and go from there.

    "content": "Acupuncture and Pregnancy Sarah Thompson of Sacred Vessel Acupuncture and Functional Medicine specializes in fertility care all the way through postpartum care with a primary focus on pregnancy. Sarah shares how acupuncture and functional medicine can help pregnant women and surrogates in their pregnancy. What is Acupuncture? Traditional Chinese Medicine is an ancient medical theory rooted in a long and rich history. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very thin needles into specific acupuncture points. Modern Acupuncture is based on the understanding of how Acupuncture affects the biochemistry of the body. The insertion of small needles into strategic Acupuncture points elicit a series of endocrine, hormonal and biochemical reactions in the body. We combine the ancient knowledge with the modern knowledge to bring together the strengths of both medical models to improve treatment success. What Is Functional Medicine? Functional medicine takes Western physiology that we all know and love and combines it with clinical nutrition. We look at the different physiological processes of the body. When we’re looking at fertility, we’re looking at how the ovary works, the growth of the end endometrial lining and the hormones responsible for that, and how nutrition plays into those functions in the body. You have over 20 years of experience working with medical doctors in the fields of pain management and OB/GYN. How do you work hand in hand with these doctors while treating a pregnant patient? I’ve been at this for a long time and I’ve definitely practiced in medical offices, which has been fantastic. I worked in an OB/GYN clinic for a number of years and that allowed me to understand their modalities of treatment. We often collaborate with physicians and midwives, discussing patient care and what we are doing nutritionally to support these women. We work together to make sure we meet our goal of a happy, healthy pregnancy, a happy, healthy birth and a happy, healthy baby! You also became a doula. Why? I worked with women in different facets of fertility and different facets of pregnancy. It was always a hard thing for me to part with my patients when it was time for labor. Now as a doula, I can offer continuity of care from IVF transfer or conception all the way through delivery. We get their body prepared for labor and I get to be there with them to support them through that process. Have you worked with surrogates? We’ve definitely helped surrogates prepare their bodies for the IVF transfer process so that they can accept that embryo successfully. We also care for surrogates through pregnancy to make sure that not only is the baby growing well, but that their body is also supporting the pregnancy correctly. We use a lot of functional medicine and acupuncture to help facilitate this. Are there any specific points in the body that you are focusing on during pregnancy? The maternal body changes drastically from literally the day of conception all the way through three months postpartum, a period known as the fourth trimester. There’s all these lovely little strategic spots through gestation that I focus on because they’re very important. These acupuncture points vary throughout pregnancy. One of our key points we emphasize is the happy baby point, which is on the inside of the calf muscle. It increases blood flow to the uterus which increases oxygen, adrenaline and nutrient flow into that baby. How can surrogates prepare themselves for birth? The best thing you can do when preparing for birth is to start early. Focus on nutrition throughout pregnancy because it makes a big difference in how that birth goes. I have a new book, Functional Maternity, that talks about the disciplines of functional medicine throughout pregnancy. A whole chapter is dedicated to preparation for childbirth because it’s so important. Traditionally, we think of preparation for childbirth as being the last couple weeks of gestation starting at 36 weeks. The actual changes in maternal physiology that go into labor and delivery, however, starts at around 28 weeks. So, with our surrogate mothers and moms in general, we really want them to do certain things starting at 28 weeks to understand how their body is changing and what they need to be doing nutritionally. This allows those changes to occur optimally when they are in labor so delivery can go smoothly. What are some key pregnancy benefits of using an acupuncturist? Throughout pregnancy, there’s a number of things acupuncture can successfully treat. Morning sickness is a big one. Acupuncture is very beneficial for reducing morning sickness throughout the first trimester. We can change neurotransmitter function and hormone function at different phases in gestation. Pregnancy acupuncture is a really good option for women experiencing depression and anxiety because it’s non-medicated. We’re not worried about putting medications in the body, which could affect the growing baby. In addition, there is an excellent study that came out of Stanford years ago that found acupuncture is more effective at mitigating postpartum depression than medication. So, that’s something that we use acupuncture a lot with. The other thing is we can help facilitate the hormones that go into the activation of labor. If we have conditions where induction is a possibility, we can help move the body along a little bit and perhaps avoid induction. Hypertension is another condition we commonly treat with acupuncture and have good success rates. Why is it so important for a mom to take care of herself while pregnant? One of the things I find with maternity care in general, and maybe even more so in a surrogate situation, is we focus so much on the health of the baby that we kind of miss the mother. The woman and her health matters during the pregnancy, because if they’re not taking care of themselves and their nutritional status, their health will follow them throughout the rest of their life. This is why caring for mothers is just as important as caring for that baby. We focus a lot on the fourth trimester in our All-In Surrogate Care and Compensation Package. How can acupuncture help recovery in the postpartum fourth trimester? Acupuncture can help to balance those hormones post pregnancy. One of the big hormone issues we see postpartum is a drop in estrogen and it’s not because the mom doesn’t produce estrogen anymore. It’s because some estrogen was being produced by the baby. So, a postpartum mother has been on an estrogen high for the last several months and then she experiences an estrogen low after the baby’s birth. We can really help her body start to resolve that gap on its own with acupuncture. That’s an example of how acupuncture can play a role in changing hormones and how they are processed. How can women prepare for birth physically and emotionally? The biggest tool in anybody’s toolbox is educating yourself to know what’s going to happen in the body and what to expect. I’m a big fan of watching videos. Surrogates have had pregnancies and births before. While they understand that process a little bit, every pregnancy is different, which is why having somebody who can help guide you becomes very important. Lastly, nutrition is key! Nutrition management is an important missing aspect in many lives that can improve our birth outcomes. Do you have any advice for breast milk pumping? Make sure that the pumping mom gets enough Vitamin D. We talk a lot now about Vitamin D deficiency being a big issue in pregnancy and, more importantly, postpartum. Mothers need to consume a minimum of one thousand international units of Vitamin D for the breast milk to contain the minimum 400 international units that the baby needs to grow correctly. A lot of pediatricians are now supplementing babies with a liquid Vitamin D supplement since so few women are meeting that demand of Vitamin D in their diet. A lot of the foods that are rich in Vitamin D are things like mushrooms, seafood, and organ meats, like liver. These are also fantastic foods for the postpartum period in that fourth trimester. Nobody is a big fan of organ meat anymore, but it helps women recover from childbirth and contains all the vitamins and minerals that were lost during that third trimester and the birth experience itself. It is a fourth trimester power food! Do you have advice for a woman who is considering becoming a surrogate? In fertility management, we always say preconception nutrition is more important than pregnancy nutrition, and the same thing applies to surrogacy. What a surrogate does in those months before transfer really makes a difference on how that pregnancy is going to go for her. We have to make sure her body is in a good position to take on that embryo and to carry it full term. There are nutritional deficiencies that can inhibit that embryo from transplanting or increase the risk of miscarriages in that first trimester. Iodine deficiency is a big one and hypothyroidism can be a big trigger for a loss. Iron deficiency in the preconception phase tends to not resolve itself throughout pregnancy. We look at making sure that women have consumed enough iron before pregnancy, so we don’t have to add in supplements later on if we don’t have to, which puts her body in a better position to handle pregnancy. How can people find you? We offer nutritional support in the preconception phase, through pregnancy and postpartum in our office in Fort Collins, Colorado and by virtual appointments.

    "content": "Since the inception of ConceiveAbilities 25 years ago, there have been incredible advances in third party reproduction, especially in surrogacy. More and more families are turning to surrogacy and more to build their families and being open about their fertility journey. Dr. Ashley Tiegs with the Atlanta Center for Reproductive Medicine and winner of the ASRM 2021 Investigator Achievement award shared her own fertility journey, what inspired her to become a Reproductive Endocrinologist and how surrogacy has helped her patients build their families on our podcast All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes. NF: You have been very open about your own infertility journey. Tell us about how your path to parenthood inspired you to become a Reproductive Endocrinologist. My husband and I met when we were in medical school. He was very open with me pretty immediately that he had Hodgkin Lymphoma as a teenager and he had alkylating chemotherapy, a pretty severe type of chemotherapy which basically kills sperm and eggs. He didn’t think that we could have kids. I started my OB/GYN rotation and I learned about the subspecialty of reproductive endocrinology and infertility. It’s how I found this field of medicine. I knew that this was the only thing I wanted to do. We waited to attempt to start a family until my last year of residency. His first semen analysis showed zero sperm and we were really devastated. We repeated the same analysis and it showed two sperm. Infertility patients know that normal analysis will show tens of millions of sperm, and it only had two. I knew that we could use Assisted Reproductive Technology and succeed with an intracytoplasmic sperm injection. So there was some hope for us to have our own biological child. And, we had our first child that way with IVF. Perseverance is really the biggest key in infertility. You have to find the treatment that’s right for you. I then did three more IVF cycles really to bank embryos because the embryo development rate was always poor and the embryos were of borderline quality. We now have two perfect children. NF: Congratulations on your beautiful family. Perseverance absolutely pays off. We’ve used that perspective a lot in our agency, whether it’s one egg, one surrogate, or one sperm. Sometimes all it takes is one, so don’t give up. When is surrogacy a viable option for your patients? We recommend a gestational carrier for patients with repeated history of embryo transfer failures in the setting of good quality embryos. because we feel that the embryo factor there is controlled. Alternatively, we may recommend a gestational carrier for women where pregnancy is contraindicated; they may have a poor obstetric history or medical history where pregnancy would be too dangerous to them or to the potential baby and it would not be prudent to put them through pregnancy. We’ll also use gestational carriers for unpartnered individuals and same sex couples that do not have any fertility factors. NF: When you have a conversation with them about surrogacy, what reaction do you get? It’s not always greeted with open arms. This can be a very low point and may be a hard thing to accept for couples. No one thinks about their journey to build a family as including perhaps a third person outside of the immediate couple. The good news is that it can be highly successful and it typically is extremely successful. NF: For those struggling with infertility, the partnership with a surrogate is a uniquely good answer for couples who have been down a road of previous failures. This is a new treatment, so it gives couples hope and a solution. That’s what we all want: a solution to infertility. I think that can be really exciting for a couple. NF: How have advances allowed surrogacy to earn a title of being one of the most successful fertility treatments out there? Careful selection of the gestational carriers has made it a really successful treatment for sure. The parents can feel very comfortable knowing that we have very strict criteria for who can become a gestational carrier. So it’s looking at their obstetric history, psychological and medical evaluation, and screening of the gestational carriers. Additionally we really recommend single embryo transfer to gestational carriers. Technological advances allow for pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy allowing for that single embryo transfer and that helps the surrogate or the gestational carrier have a safe pregnancy. NF: Why is it a requirement that a surrogate not only have a healthy uterus, but a proven obstetrical history of being able to carry healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies? Obstetric histories tend to repeat themselves. We often see that. So we really don’t know what someone’s pregnancy is going to be like until they have one. So at least one pregnancy that is healthy is a really good indication that another one will be healthy as well. NF: Who makes a good gestational carrier? All the gestational carriers I’ve ever met really desire to make a major difference in people’s lives. They enjoy pregnancy. So there’s that emotional and social aspect of it. As the intended parents’ and the gestational carrier’s physician, my goal is primarily to make sure it’s a safe pregnancy. NF: Surrogacy used to be viewed as a last resort for patients undergoing fertility treatment. We are now seeing physicians speeding up that conversation about partnering with a surrogate faster than ever before. Why do you think that is? I think it’s multifaceted. With the technologic advances in our field, we have more advanced embryo diagnostics. If we find that we’ve got good quality embryos and we’re not having success, perhaps surrogacy is the best option. We’ve also solidified the connections between infertility clinics and the gestational carrier agencies. We have more access to gestational carriers. It’s only become more and more widespread and more common and socially acceptable when we’ve got celebrities sharing their experience. It’s becoming more accessible as well and so that makes it an easier option to offer to patients. NF: Surrogacy has become normalized, but there are still some myths about surrogacy. The most common surrogacy myth I encounter is that perhaps the surrogate is a traditional surrogate and that they would donate eggs and carry a pregnancy. Gestational carriers have no genetic relation to the child they are carrying for the intended parent. NF: Let’s pivot a little bit and talk about the advancements in care of the surrogate like fourth trimester support for the healing and recovery after a woman who is a gestational carrier gives birth. The fourth trimester is absolutely extremely important and is probably the most important trimester. It really is a full 12 weeks of healing. It’s very important for the body to regain its nutrients. Emotionally too. I’m so glad that this is part of ConceiveAbilities’ program and care, because the attention that is given to the gestational carriers during this time is extremely important. NF: What’s your advice to a woman who might be considering becoming a surrogate? I feel like women who are considering becoming a surrogate or a carrier, they don’t need advice. These are some of the most caring, generous people I’ve ever met. My advice is to take care of yourself. And that’s really the best way to take care of the baby that you’re carrying and to help the intended parents. NF: I couldn’t agree more. These are remarkable women: truly incredible, generous giving, tough, tenacious, and persevering. They’re really something.

Our All In Surrogate Care & Compensation Package includes partum care from the beginning all the way through your fourth trimester, including information on how you fuel your body. Nutrition is just as important for you, as it is for the baby you are carrying. And, Kendra Aronson, founder of the newly launched Pregnant and Hungry, has guidance for you. Through her subscription-based website with pregnancy-safe recipes, she created a one-stop resource for everything you need to know about what to eat, and what not to eat, during your surrogacy journey. Read on to learn more about Kendra and her advice – and listen to the full All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes! The Pregnant and Hungry Pregnancy 101 guide is a resource with all the nutrient-rich foods to benefit both you and the baby you’re carrying. This includes a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, meat, seafood, legumes, herbs, seeds, dairy, and grains, and combines all of that together in a very wholesome, holistic way. The site breaks your pregnancy nutrition plan into three main buckets: foods to eat, foods to avoid and prenatal vitamins. It also provides nuggets of information on what vitamins you need for pregnancy and why, and how to get them from natural, nutrient rich foods. For instance: what does calcium bring to the table? Calcium is responsible for healthy bone mineralization, muscle contractility and hormone functioning. When you’re pregnant, calcium requirements increase to support the formation of a new skeleton and the physiological functioning of that little body. It also brings additional benefits to the table. If you’re sufficient in calcium, you have more stable blood pressure, which decreases the risk of pregnancy induced hypertension and preterm birth. Not only do you get the 411 on great ingredients, Pregnant and Hungry shares searchable recipes for everything from how to encourage lactation to boosting energy to labor-inducing meals. Recipes are organized by pregnancy specific ailments like morning sickness, constipation, heartburn, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, or hydration. You can filter by dietary restrictions including dairy-free, gluten-free or vegetarian or cravings like sweet or salty. There is even a filter for freezer-friendly recipes for post delivery recovery during your fourth trimester. Pregnancy Tips: Think of eating well in 72 hour chunks. So instead of beating yourself up about how you ate in one 24-hour period, think of it in 72-hour periods. Give yourself grace and three days to hit all of the important categories. Consider the mantra of everything in moderation, including moderation. Most importantly, eat a well balanced diet where you can pronounce all the ingredients; no mystery preservatives or added things that should not be in food.

    "content": "While Kristin Welch is today the leader of all of our operations at ConceiveAbilities, she was the pioneer who built the foundation for what is today’s Surrogate Engagement team at ConceiveAbilities. This team welcomes, screens and vets the thousands of surrogate applications received by ConceiveAbilities every month. Kristin is an efficiency enthusiast; her knack for defining and streamlining processes has helped mold this team into the well-oiled machine it is today. As a registered nurse as well as a surrogate herself, Kristin brings a valuable perspectives to her work. We recently spoke with Kristin about how the Surrogate Engagement Team came to be and, especially, the effort made to consider the motivations of each applicant while reviewing their application. Honoring Each Applicant’s Vision “Members of the team and I have been in the shoes of these applicants before, so we understand that each woman has a vision in mind for her journey. In fact, most applicants have experienced something very specific that inspired their interest in becoming a surrogate and we aim to honor their inspiration,” states Kristin. Kristin mentions that her team often hears from applicants who specifically include on their application that they want to work with same-sex parents as a means of showing their support for the LGBT community. Other applicants specifically request to carry for a heterosexual couple struggling with infertility. Kristin adds, “Many times an applicant has had an aunt or a friend whom they loved who struggled to build their family and these applicants want to become a surrogate in honor of their loved one. Kristin says, “Our Surrogate Engagement team, as well as our Matching Matters team, works hard to ensure that each applicant’s inspiration for wanting to become a surrogate is honored.” Kristin acknowledges that occasionally an applicant’s specific vision, or a combination of very specific criteria, will require additional time to find her the right match. There are even rare occurrences when the applicant’s vision for her match is not compatible with the options available at ConceiveAbilities. In these cases, the team suggests that the applicant consider applying to a different reputable agency. Along the same lines, Kristin shares that she encourages applicants who would likely make wonderful surrogates, but fall just outside of the ConceiveAbilities’ exceptionally high standards. “I believe in surrogacy in general and if a woman hears the calling to help another family but we are unable to work with her, for whatever reason, I am still cheering for her and hope she has the fulfilling experience I had.” The team encourages applicants to join the Surrogacy Learning Center to find out about changes they might be able to make to qualify as a surrogate and to discover additional ways of supporting hopeful people that want to become parents.

    "content": "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, surrogacy has the highest rate of success of any fertility treatment. The CDC reports in vitro fertilization (IVF) with a donor egg has a success rate of 52%. Higher still is the rate of success with a surrogate. Fertility centers in the US have a surrogacy success rate of about 75% and that number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. Success is seen in the growth rate of surrogacy. The CDC reports that a gestational carrier was part of 5% of all embryo transfers in 2019, up from barely 1% a decade ago. Medical pioneer Dr. Brian Kaplan with Fertility Centers of Illinois has been passionately leading the way in infertility for nearly three decades in IVF, egg donation, gestational surrogacy and more. Dr. Kaplan joined our All Things Conceivable: A Podcast with Nazca Fontes to explain what this statistic means, and the context behind what it means both now and going forward, for intended parents and surrogates embarking on a surrogacy journey. Listen to the full podcast here, and you can hear firsthand what an honor it is to have Dr. Kaplan speaking with us. And read on for a summary of the key points made by Dr. Kaplan. Understanding the Reason For Surrogacy “There are very different couples and people who need surrogates and the results will vary depending on what the underlying reason is for doing surrogacy. In infertility, we have to have realistic expectations and they have to be set based on each, specific individualized story. The success rate of surrogacy is very dependent on what the reason for surrogacy is. Obviously, the uterus plays a role and the sperm, but the critical variable in getting pregnant is the egg. Women are born with their lifetime supply of eggs. With age, women lose their eggs; by the time they reach puberty, half their eggs are gone. By the time they reach menopause, all their eggs are gone. And, as women age, there is also reduction in egg quality. If an egg comes from a woman who’s in her forties, the success rate with surrogacy will not be 70%. It will be determined by the quality and age of the egg and subsequently the embryo. If the intended mother is 38, the success rate will be lower because the miscarriage rate will be higher. If an egg comes from a qualified egg donor, typically a younger woman, then the miscarriage rate is under 10% and the success rate ranges from 90 to 95%. It’s important to realize that each circumstance is unique and depends on many factors.” Surrogacy Success Rates for a Traditional Infertility Patient Using Donor Eggs And A Surrogate “The success rate with a patient using donor eggs and a surrogate will be the highest of all, because that is the ideal situation. You have relatively young eggs and therefore young embryos, so the implantation rates are very high and the miscarriage rates will be very low. If you use a surrogate who has a proven uterus that has been tested, you have a combination of the best of all worlds. That success rate can be well into the seventies and once they are pregnant, a 90 or 95% success rate. You have a normal uterus and embryos that are young from young eggs. That’s the ideal situation that provides the highest chance of a healthy baby.” Surrogacy Success Rates for Gay Men “The population of same sex male couples or gay men pursuing surrogacy to build their families is growing tremendously. The surrogacy process for gay men uses a donor egg together with a surrogate. In this case, the success rate of surrogacy goes up exponentially because now you have a young egg together with a proven uterus, or a proven surrogate. Now, your pregnancy success rates can be well into the seventies. So if it is a gay couple or male using surrogacy, the pregnancy rates are very high and can easily be around 70% for every embryo transfer. The success rates are the best of everything we do, but it is a commitment and I’m always humbled by that commitment.” What Is A Surrogate’s Role in the Success of A Surrogacy Journey? “Surrogates are women who are unique. Every time I meet one of these women, it is truly humbling that someone makes the decision to be a surrogate. They are contributing to giving life and that is really a very deep decision. There are surrogate requirements that a woman has to meet physically and emotionally. For me, age is not as critical because the uterus ages very little, as long as she’s proven to have had a healthy pregnancy. The surrogate will have to pass medical clearances and we do a whole battery of testing, both medically, genetically, and psychologically to make sure that she will have a safe and healthy surrogacy journey. I look at the surrogate’s history from an obstetrical point of view. If she’s had a strong history of pregnancy without complications, then she becomes ideal as a surrogate. It’s not a simple process. There’s a lot of education and there has to be a camaraderie and personal relationship between all of us, so everybody knows exactly what the expectation is. They have to trust who they are working with and that the legal system is all in place.” Read more about surrogate mother requirements. The Importance of the Best Surrogacy Team “The surrogacy team is very important. If you have a surrogacy agency that is incompetent, everything’s going to fall apart. If you’re looking for a less expensive way out, because it’s just cheap, that’s the result you’re going to get. This is life. You don’t want to take a chance with anything, whether it’s on the recruitment side, the legal side, or the medical side. You want those all optimized as much as science has available, even with its imperfections. And I think the collaboration between all of the parties is the key to a successful surrogacy journey. None of us can do this on our own. And I think why we get the success rates we do is a reflection of that collaboration. All physicians have different approaches and there are plenty of people who do a good job with surrogacy. We will have different styles, just like in art and music and everything else. And as a patient, you have to see someone you’re going to feel comfortable with in your heart, with your trust, and thinking you’re getting the best care. The approach some physicians have is a purely scientific approach. You base it on algorithms and that’s one approach to doing it. And it works very well and I respect that. I look at it a little differently. Of course what we do is science, but it’s also humanities. This is all about people. You have to get inside each other’s souls. You have to understand where they’re coming from, what their desires are, and what their dreams are.” What Is A Surrogacy Agency’s Role “Choosing a surrogacy agency that has earned a stellar reputation plays such a big role in a successful surrogacy journey. It’s not just the physician. Once the fertility physician gets patients to pregnancy, our care ends. We rely and we affiliate ourselves with the best agencies, like ConceiveAbilities, because we know that they are going to be taken care of all the way through their surrogacy journey. When you look at the complexity and enormity of a surrogacy journey, a patient should think about good standards of care, so that they don’t cut corners and they don’t take risks unnecessarily. It’s the same when you choose an IVF clinic as well. It’s very important to find someone with experience, so they know how to deal with many situations. My advice for intended parents and surrogates is to look for a surrogacy agency and ask a few questions. What is their reputation? How long have they been doing this? What kind of volume do they do? What kind of patients do they take care of? Can they provide service? Not just locally, but nationally. I wouldn’t look for the shortcut. I wouldn’t look for something that’s quick and easy because that’s where the problems occur.” Learn why surrogates and intended parents have been choosing ConceiveAbilities for 25 years and running. Medical Advances that Contribute to The Success of Surrogacy “The genetic advances have exploded and we’ll get more and more advanced in the ability to test for genetic disease before pregnancy. Artificial intelligence is the hot term that everybody’s talking about. I’m still not sure what role it plays in the fertility field, but it’s inevitable. At what pace and how we’ll utilize it is still unknown. Surrogacy is a growing part of our practice at fertility clinics. The population that needs a surrogate is growing as well. Today, surrogacy is broadly accepted. If you go to the schools today in all of the major metropolitan cities, a third of those children are born by working with surrogates, donor egg, donor sperm. There are single mothers, single fathers, gay parents. It’s such a heterogeneous group of how children are conceived. And at the end of the day, if you have children that are born as healthy as possible, that’s the bottom line. How we achieve that with technology is just a matter of individuals being comfortable. I think it will evolve where employers will realize how important it is and cover some of the expenses and costs with surrogacy. And I think all people should have an option to have children.” Calling All Surrogates And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy?

    "content": "If you’ve considered becoming a surrogate mother, you’ve likely done plenty of research about the medical procedures, compensation, legal contracts and more. But, you’re probably also wondering – how do I know if I’m a candidate for surrogacy? Dr. Angeline Beltsos, the CEO and Chief Medical Officer of Vios Fertility Institute, lays out the basic requirements, and why each requirement exists. These are some of the most frequently asked questions about what could disqualify a gestational carrier. Can I be a surrogate mother if I’ve never been pregnant? No. We do require that you have given birth to and we have this requirement for several reasons. Most importantly, it allows us to ensure that you’ve had a good medical experience with pregnancy and have enjoyed an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. Second, having already experienced pregnancy, we have great assurance that you have an idea of what you’re undertaking as a gestational carrier. Can I be a surrogate if I’m not married? Yes. Being married is not a requirement, but it is important to consider who will be your support system during the surrogacy journey. You will, of course, have your match manager readily available to answer questions and offer support, along with your Surrogate Sisterhood support group, but that only meets part of the need. From emotional support to everyday logistics such as childcare and housekeeping, it helps to have someone – perhaps a network of people – you can reliably depend on during the year or more of your surrogacy engagement. All gestational carriers, married or not, benefit from that support. Consider who those people are in your own life and how they might best be able to rally around you. Can I be a surrogate if I’m receiving government assistance? It depends. When you apply, we will talk with you to better understand your situation and provide our feedback.Certain assistance programs, such as supplemented childcare, are not disqualifying. You should, however, consider whether the compensation you receive as a surrogate will make you ineligible for certain support programs. Can I be a surrogate mother after tubal ligation? Yes. Because it does not impact your uterus, you can be a surrogate after a tubal ligation, sometimes referred to as getting your “tubes tied.” This form of permanent birth control will prevent you from getting pregnant naturally when an egg enters the fallopian tube to be fertilized. And because it is not your egg being used in a surrogate pregnancy, your fallopian tubes don’t need to function to become pregnant as a surrogate through In Vitro Fertilization. Can I be a surrogate at any age? Preferred candidates for surrogacy are between the ages of 21-39. Studies indicate this is the optimum age range for childbearing, meaning fewer complications and, typically, a faster recovery. Can I be a surrogate anywhere in the United States? Almost every state is a viable location from which to be a surrogate. Because surrogacy laws are not federally mandated and can vary from state to state (even county to county), however, not all states are favorable towards gestational surrogacy. Michigan, for example, forbids compensated surrogacy. Stay tuned, though, as the tide is turning quickly. New York just passed exciting, state-of-the-art legislation after a hard-fought battle. Several states, including New Jersey and Vermont, secured laws protecting surrogacy in 2018. What if I think I am disqualified to be a surrogate mother? If you think you are disqualified to be a surrogate, we still encourage you to apply to be a surrogate. Our team may be able to find a way for you to follow your dream of becoming a surrogate and, if you aren’t able to proceed, perhaps you have a friend that may qualify and your desire to help another family can be fulfilled by educating her.

    "content": "As Dr. Anate Brauer of Shady Grove Fertility shares, a surrogacy journey has many complexities. Working with professionals that have the right process, open communication, and experience is critical to having a successful outcome: a healthy baby home with its parents. Your embryo transfer is, no doubt, one of the most exciting steps in this challenging and complex process! Finally, after a lengthy period of screening and preparation, retrieval and fertilization, your embryos are ready to be transferred and will, hopefully, result in a successful pregnancy. But before you complete the embryo transfer process, there are 5 important things to know about those tiny cells. 1. It’s worth the wait. Typically, embryos are transferred between three to seven days after fertilization. During this waiting period, they are culturing in the lab and become blastocysts once they reach day 5 of development. While you may be feeling more than ready to move forward and have a transfer as soon as possible, it’s actually best to wait. The longer an embryo has to develop, the more likely the embryologist will be able to select the highest quality embryos to transfer. It also allows time for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) to screen for genetic abnormalities. A more viable blastocyst means a greater chance that the embryo transfers successfully. At day 5 of development, the uterine lining is typically the most receptive to an embryo that would just be leaving the fallopian tube. 2. Less is more. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) have the most widely-regarded criteria for embryo transfer precautions. They currently recommend single-embryo transfer (eSET), based on the following evidence: A multiple birth often results in more complications for the mother and babies SET in women under 38 years of age has no impact on live birth rates Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) helps determine the healthiest embryo to implant, resulting in a greater chance of pregnancy with just one embryo 3. Age may not be as crucial as we once thought. While there is no doubt that a woman’s fertility begins to decline in her early 30s, the clock may not need to tick quite as fast for IVF patients. The Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine (CCRM) recently conducted a research study to evaluate just how efficient a single embryo transfer would be for an IVF patient up to age 42. The stipulation: all were day 5 embryos that had undergone comprehensive chromosomal screening (CCS) to confirm chromosomal normality. The results: the rate of blastocyst aneuploidy, or presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, was vastly different – 62.4% in women between 38-42 versus 36.7% in the group 37 or younger. But as long as a chromosomally normal blastocyst was transferred, the live birth rates were almost identical: 60% in the advanced maternal age group and 64.6% in the younger group. “What the study says is that if you correct for aneuploidy, if you screen out embryos that are chromosomally abnormal, and you’re transferring a single embryo,” explains Dr. Schoolcraft, “the success really has no variance with age up to and including age 42.” It’s a far cry from previous IVF recommendations. Dr. Schoolcraft acknowledges, “If you look at SART and CDC data nationally, what you see is the opposite. There’s a profound decline in success rates around age 35 and it’s linear.” However, “What we’re saying is ‘yes, that’s true, because obviously you’re putting back more genetically lethal embryos as the patient is getting older. But if you take the same patient and screen out the abnormal embryos [with CCS] and you’re putting back a normal embryo, then up to age 42, age has no impact,” Dr. Schoolcraft explains. 4. Egg donation can maximize your chances. Still, age is just one of many factors when considering the embryo transfer success rate. While the prime age for an intended mother going through egg retrieval is 26-35 years old, utilizing an egg donor can increase your chances of building a family for other reasons too. Overall health should be considered, both lifestyle and family medical history. The donor must go through rigorous screening and monitoring to help ensure that any eggs retrieved are of optimum quality in order to create a healthy embryo. If you have unexplained infertility, a history of miscarriages, or have discovered genetic abnormalities, egg donation is a viable way to have a successful embryo transfer and, in turn, a healthy baby. 5. It’s just fine to freeze. Advancements in technique and technology have completely changed the landscape for freezing and preserving embryos. In the past, fresh transfers were the norm because it was difficult to keep an embryo viable beyond 3 days, much less safely freeze and then thaw them for later transfer. Today, frozen embryos have over a 95% successful thaw rate and the success rates of a fresh and frozen embryo transfer (FET) are nearly identical. One study actually showed that when the intended mother has a higher progesterone level, successful pregnancy rates were actually better with frozen embryos. All of this is great news for intended parents, who no longer need to stress about the often-complicated logistics of an IVF cycle and subsequent embryo transfer. And, it’s an especially promising finding for third-party reproduction. For intended parents that are working with an egg donor or gestational carrier, there is no need for additional coordination of cycles or schedules to complete the retrieval and fertilization. Embryos can be created at any time for future transfer. We are here to answer your questions about the best ways to navigate IVF.

    "content": "If you’ve finished building your family, it’s common to take more permanent measures to prevent pregnancy. From having an IUD inserted to surgical procedures like a tubal ligation or male vasectomy, there are plenty of options. But what if your situation changes? If you decide that you’d like to have another baby – whether it’s to add to your own family or to help someone else as a gestational surrogate – can you get pregnant after a tubal ligation? Read on for everything you need to know about conception and IVF after tubal ligation. What is tubal ligation? Tubal ligation, sometimes referred to as getting your “tubes tied,” is an interruption of the fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy. Typically, it involves the surgical removal of the middle section of the tubes. This requires about a week of light bed-rest, followed by a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) three months later to check the tubes. Using x-ray technology, HSG uses dye to show the flow from the uterus and fallopian tubes into the uterine cavity. This will confirm blockages that prevent pregnancy – which is, of course, the goal after a tubal ligation. Can you get pregnant if your tubes are tied? The chances are slim: about 1 in 1,000 after the first year and between 2-10 in 1,000 after 5 years. While most women can successfully have a tubal ligation, reversal so that you can intentionally become pregnant is not a guarantee. It requires enough healthy tissue on both ends of the tube for it to reconnect and open all the way through to function properly. Even then, 20% of women will have so much scar tissue that the flow of the tube is blocked. HSG is done again after a reversal to check for proper flow. There is also a greater risk for ectopic pregnancy after a tubal reversal. Typically, a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus; in an ectopic pregnancy, it most often attaches in the fallopian tube. The pregnancy cannot proceed normally, and if left untreated it can be life threatening. After a tubal reversal, the risk for an ectopic pregnancy is about 10 to 20 percent. So how likely is it to get pregnant after a tubal ligation? Ultimately, the success rate for pregnancy following a tubal reversal is about 40 percent in women under 37. Pregnancy Options After Tubal Ligation A great option to pursue pregnancy following a tubal ligation is through in vitro fertilization (IVF); in fact, the process is not any more complicated to do with your tubes tied. In natural conception, the egg must travel through the fallopian tube to be fertilized by sperm. With IVF, pregnancy can occur bypassing the fallopian tubes all together. It gives patients a higher chance of pregnancy in the shortest amount of time without having a significant surgical procedure. If you don’t want to have another tubal ligation after the pregnancy or deal with another method of birth control long term, it can be a great solution. Another pressing question about tubal ligation and fertility treatment: does insurance cover IVF after tubal ligation? In most cases, no. Unfortunately, insurance doesn’t cover IVF under any circumstance in many states. It’s something to investigate with your carrier, but many will not cover IVF after a voluntary tubal ligation. Can you be a surrogate after tubal ligation? Yes! It could actually mean you’re a great candidate for surrogacy; you have proven fertility and are most likely done building your own family, both of which are important qualities for a gestational carrier. Plus – and this is also a critical point – it’s extremely unlikely you’ll become pregnant on your own before the embryo transfer. Because the egg will be from the intended mother or an egg donor, your ovaries and fallopian tubes will not be involved in the process at all. Be a surrogate As Dr. Channing Burks Chatmon, a Reproductive Endocrinologist with Fertility Centers of Illinois explains, professionals are available to help you through these and many other issues related to family building. Calling All Surrogates And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy?

    "content": "Dr. Tomer Singer, with Shady Grove Fertility New York and an award-winning physician, explains why people need to use a surrogate. Whether they have had a medical issue, like a hysterectomy or cancer, have had multiple miscarriages or are a same sex couple, surrogacy allows all people who want to become parents build a family. Role Models for Surrogacy: Everyday Moms and Dads Who Worked With Surrogates As with the advancement of any progressive social ideal, the stories of every day families are the best way to spread the word. Some fantastic surrogate-assisted families from California to Boston recently shared their stories with VeryWell Family, including our very own Crystal Patel. Why is surrogacy becoming so popular? Six Reasons to Consider a Surrogate Mother There are many reasons why hopeful parents might choose to take the route of having a baby through a surrogate mother; here are just six of the most common: Age: Women’s fertility and ability to have a successful pregnancy declines with age. The good news is that a surrogate, in addition to having had a successful prior delivery of her own child, will be the right age to carry a successful pregnancy to term. The age range requirement when accepting surrogates or gestational carriers is generally from 21-39 years old. Lack of a Uterus: The woman in a couple wishing to start a family may not have a uterus. This can be the result of a rare genetic malformation affecting as many as one in twelve thousand women, or the woman may have had her uterus removed. This is sometimes a necessary step in treating certain forms of cancer. The lack of a uterus precludes any possibility of the woman bearing a child herself. Same-Sex Couples: Gay couples, most commonly men, will sometimes use donated eggs and the services of a surrogate mother to create a family. At ConceiveAbilities, we are delighted to report that this practice is rapidly gaining in widespread public acceptance, as well as being long validated by the medical community. For more information on the subject, please check out our information on same sex parenting. Uterine Structural Problem: Less severe than the above, a woman might have an inherent condition or uterine defect that makes conception of a child difficult. Alternatively, a malformation of the uterus can have little impact on conception but can make it impossible for the woman to carry her child to term safely. Other Medical Conditions: Some medical conditions, while they don’t directly affect a woman’s physical ability to bear children, can have an impact upon her ability to carry a healthy child to term – particularly while maintaining her own health at the same time. Conditions such as heart disease, kidney disease, or severe diabetes can turn a pregnancy into a life-threatening event for mother and child alike, as might a history of certain types of cancer. Also, certain medicines being taken to treat an unrelated health problem or physical condition may put an unborn child’s health at risk. Personal Decision: As modern family advocates, we believe everyone has the right to build families in the way that supports their personal choices. For some women, surrogacy is not a medical choice, but a social choice. Naturally, there are many other reasons for deciding to have a child by working with a surrogate mother, but these six options alone represent the reasons for tens of thousands of couples in dozens of countries around the world – people who could see their dream of a biological child made reality by means of surrogacy. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate?

    "content": "Family building opportunities have come a long way and surrogacy is fast growing option. With that growth comes the awareness of surrogacy as a very special means of creating a family – but it can also leave room for confusion. To help set the record straight, we asked Dr. Daniel Shapiro, Medical Director of Reproductive Biology Associates, to explain the difference between gestational carriers and other types of surrogacy. Watch his clear explanation, and read on to understand more. What is a gestational carrier? The most common form of modern surrogacy is achieved with a gestational carrier. This is a woman who undergoes in vitro fertilization and carries an embryo that was created with the intended mother or donor’s egg and the intended father or donor’s sperm. The gestational carrier is not genetically related to the child. Because gestational surrogacy does not involve a genetic link between the surrogate and the baby, it has become a safe and popular means of starting or growing a family. What is a traditional surrogate? A traditional surrogate, on the other hand, is the biological mother, while the gestational carrier is not. This typically means the embryo is creating using the surrogate’s eggs and, perhaps, Intrauterine Insemination (“IUI”) using the father or sperm donor’s sperm. It is not recommended to attempt a pregnancy with a surrogate using her own eggs due to the underlying emotional and legal implications. If the surrogate is also the biological mother, there is a greater risk to all parties. For instance, she could have legal grounds to challenge custody or could, conversely, be left with medical and financial responsibility for the baby. Some clinics are not comfortable managing traditional surrogacy arrangements, and in many locations, traditional surrogacy is completely outlawed. The Gestational Surrogacy Process After a series of medical screenings, the gestational surrogacy process begins by preparing for implantation. To harvest embryos for the surrogacy journey, the intended mother or egg donor undergoes an egg retrieval. Embryos are created using these eggs and the intended father or donor’s sperm and then then transferred to the gestational carrier’s uterus. Anyone considering how to become a surrogate mother must have a solid understanding of the surrogacy journey. She must be fully educated on what is involved, both medically and legally, and have a solid support system throughout this unique commitment. Surrogacy and the Law Surrogacy laws in the United States can vary widely from state to state and are always evolving. In states where surrogacy is not supported or the law is unclear, intended parents may have to go through an adoption process to gain custody of the child. In other states, pre-birth orders called “declaration of parentage” allow intended parents to be declared the legal parents, even prior to their baby’s birth. It is imperative that all contracts and agreements are drafted by lawyers with deep experience in third party reproduction and reproductive rights. The surrogacy process is complex but can be a rewarding experience – even a miracle – for everyone involved. Join our Surrogacy Learning Center to continue the conversation and learn more.

Surrogacy is the most successful treatment for infertility, with a 75% success rate. That number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. ConceiveAbilities has been helping hopeful people build their families by working with surrogate mothers and egg donors for 25 years, a time during which assisted reproductive technology has gone through a revolution. And, we’ve learned so much during that time as we’ve witnessed an entire generation of families come into being. We are invested in providing expert information needed to embark on a successful surrogacy journey.

Why Does Someone Become a Surrogate? How Do Surrogates Find Intended Parents? How do Surrogates Prepare for a Successful Surrogacy Journey? How Does Surrogacy Differ from One Part of the Country to Another? What is Surrogacy? Surrogacy is a modern and growing means of bringing new life into the world, where a woman carries a baby for another person or a couple. The intended parents undergo IVF meaning fertilization outside of the body, to transfer their embryo into the surrogate’s uterus. In our work at ConceiveAbilities, surrogates are not genetically or legally related to the baby and are compensated for their time and service by the intended parents. In 2019, more than 17,000 births took place by surrogate in the United States and the market is steadily growing at 15% per year based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And, in the past ten years, the percentage of all IVF transfers that took place with a gestational carrier grew more than 5-fold, from just over 1% to 5.4%. A surrogate, or gestational carrier, is a woman who carries a baby for an individual or a couple that has no genetic relationship to her. The person who is trying to have a baby with the help of the surrogate is known as an intended parent. At ConceiveAbilities, we work with intended parents who undergo IVF so that the surrogate can carry a baby to whom she is not genetically or legally related. The surrogate is paid for her time and efforts by the intended parent(s). The embryo is created from the intended father’s sperm, or donor sperm, and the intended mother’s egg, or donor egg. When the baby is born, the intended parents are listed on the birth certificate as the legal parents and assume all responsibility for the child. Founder and CEO, Nazca Fontes, shared ConceiveAbilities expert knowledge of the surrogacy process with Healthline for their article What Is Gestational Surrogacy. People often misunderstand what a gestational carrier, or surrogate, is. Today, in a modern surrogacy journey, a gestational surrogate has no genetic relation to the baby she is carrying for another person. In prior times, however, a traditional surrogate used her egg and also carried the baby for the intended family. Dr. Daniel Shapiro of Reproductive Biology Associates further explains the difference between a traditional vs gestational surrogate. To understand surrogacy success rates is to understand how and why surrogacy is the best chance in making a dream of a family come true. This data helps potential surrogate mothers have confidence that their time and commitment to helping a family is highly likely to have a joyous outcome. Learn more about how surrogacy works and why it’s the most successful fertility treatment. Why Does Someone Need a Surrogate? There are many reasons people choose surrogacy to make their dream of a family come true including infertility, medical reasons, and men who don’t have a uterus. Some women have medical reasons like our intended mother Kelly Cesare who had a heart transplant and survived cancer. She shared her story in the New York Post article Surrogacy Legal in NY: What This Means For New Yorkers. Intended parent Ashley Katzen shared her fertility journey and how she decided to use a surrogate to build her family in An Intended Parent’s Surrogacy Journey. And ConceiveAbilities Intended Families, Crystal Patel & Kunal Mody and Randy Rowe & Kyle Keigan shared their surrogacy journey with VeryWell Family. Between 10-20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. According to the March of Dimes, that number may be as high as 50% when we take into account pregnancies ending before a woman misses a menstrual cycle. Intended parent, Lara Beth Levy, shared how she and her husband chose to use a surrogate after suffering miscarriages with the NY Post. Not all surrogacy journeys begin with an infertility diagnosis. Some choose surrogacy for personal reasons. Surrogacy is also a highly successful option for the LGBTQ+ community and single men to become parents. Listen to A Single Dad’s Surrogacy Journey with Joseph Tito of The Dad Diaries to hear how Joseph, a single gay dad, became a father through his surrogacy journey. Learn more about the people a woman can help by becoming a surrogate in Six Reasons to Use a Surrogate Mother. Surrogates are so very needed and treasured to grow families. Learn more about all the reasons families and couples use a surrogate. What is Infertility? Infertility is defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner and is inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. In patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at six months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. Infertility affects 6.7 million women in the U.S., about 11% of the population’s reproductive-age population. It’s estimated that 1 in 8 couples (or 12% of married women) has trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy. Fertility declines as people age. A couple of ages 29-33 with a normal functioning reproductive system has only a 20-25% chance of conceiving in any month. After six months of trying, 60% of couples will conceive without medical assistance. Approximately one-third of infertility is attributed to the female partner, one-third to the male partner, and one-third is caused by a combination of problems in both partners or is unexplained. What causes infertility? There is a wide range of potential sources. For instance, one cause of female infertility is something called hostile cervical mucus, often referred to as a hostile uterus. Hashimoto’s disease is also linked to infertility and can make getting pregnant more difficult. That’s because decreased levels of thyroid hormone interfere with ovulation. Another cause of female infertility has to do with a hormone called prolactin. When levels of prolactin are high, it can be an indicator of deeper hormonal issues and, potentially, lead to infertility. Learn more about infertility and how it affects 1 in 8 couples. What Are Infertility Treatments? Some women seek infertility treatment using medicines like Letrozole to induce ovulation and improve endometrial thickness. Since Letrozole only addresses ovulation, it doesn’t impact other potential root causes of infertility. 40% of female infertility is related to tubal factor infertility. In order to get an official diagnosis, doctors may perform an hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test, a procedure that can help diagnose tubal occlusion or obstruction, as well as uterine malformations, pelvic inflammatory disease, and Asherman’s syndrome. Once confirmed, women may have a clearer understanding of the next steps to take in order to build their family. Couples that are pursuing infertility treatments may live on an emotional roller coaster, as each pregnancy attempt is high stakes. They learn the difference between a viable and non-viable pregnancy and, while a couple who suffers from a non-viable pregnancy may well find future success, repeated setbacks may lead the couple to consider a different path to build their family. Learn more about what are infertility treatments. How Do Intended Parents Find a Surrogate? A surrogacy journey requires a large team of professionals to reach the end goal of having a child. Finding the right surrogate to partner with can make all the difference in a successful surrogacy journey. Some intended parents choose to source their own surrogates and find themselves in a partnership that isn’t what they expected. A team of professionals is essential to find a surrogate who has shared values and expectations. A surrogacy journey is a deeply personal journey for both the intended parent and surrogate. ConceiveAbilities properly vets potential surrogates to ensure she is both physically and emotionally prepared to embark on a safe and healthy surrogacy journey. Because of our diligence, 95% of our surrogates pass fertility clinic medical clearance, saving loss of precious time and potential heartache of not being able to continue a surrogacy journey. Often, when people source their own surrogate, they are not prepared for the legal expertise and time it takes to manage a journey. ConceiveAbilities guides both parties through creating a legal contract outlining the surrogacy journey. Additionally, surrogacy laws are complex and differ from state to state and sometimes even county to county and can lead to difficult and expensive parentage and unnecessary stress in a time that should be joyous. A surrogacy journey is longer than a natural pregnancy. ConceiveAbilities ensures that intended parents and surrogates alike are educated and emotionally prepared for a longer journey. Your roadmap, built for you, is rooted in 25 years of experience in navigating clinic-by-clinic (and doctor-by-doctor) requirements for surrogate qualifications, state-by-state (and county-by-county) requirements for securing parentage, relationship dynamics between intended parents and gestational carriers in making important decisions, and the unique ups-and-downs that every surrogacy journey presents. ConceiveAbilities provides expertise in every facet of the journey to support your successful process, such as in-house mental health professionals, to the joyful outcome we all strive for: a healthy baby home with its parents. Learn more about success stories with ConceiveAbilities and how we match intended parents with the perfect surrogate. Why Does Someone Become a Surrogate? For many people, their path to parenthood has been challenging. Knowing that surrogacy gives them the best chance to hold their baby in their arms is remarkable. As more people turn to surrogacy, more women are finding themselves called to surrogacy. Why? ConceiveAbilities recently hired research firm Accelerant Research to better understand surrogates. The firm surveyed 100 surrogates, more than 500 qualified surrogacy prospects and more than 1,000 women from the general population. Of the surrogates and qualified surrogacy prospects, Accelerant found: More than half volunteer regularly Nearly half are registered blood and organ donors Almost one-quarter of them foster pets More than three-quarters said they did so because they knew someone personally in need Two-thirds said they had first-hand exposure to a relative or close friend’s struggle with weighing the infertility “We found that the single biggest motivation for surrogates is the simple desire to help,” Nazca Fontes, CEO of ConceiveAbilities shared. “Eighty-seven percent said they find joy in helping others; 74 percent reported they are motivated by a sense of empowerment as a surrogate.” Other driving factors include that 78 percent of these women know someone in need and 68 percent want to support the LGBTQ community. Deciding to become a surrogate is a deeply personal and courageous decision. There is a lot of information about surrogacy to research. Listen to our podcast Busting Surrogacy Myths with OB-GYN Dr. Heather Carlson who explains the facts of surrogacy and dispels some surrogate misconceptions. One of the biggest surrogacy myths is that the surrogate is genetically related to the baby. ConceiveAbilities surrogates have no genetic relationship to the intended parent(s)’ child. It is important to understand the process of gestational surrogacy and the motivation behind why women want to become a surrogate. A woman thinking about becoming a surrogate may want to know what could disqualify her in the surrogate application process. Our team is always on hand to answer any questions and provide support throughout the process of learning about surrogacy. For women considering becoming a surrogate, the best resource we can provide is personal experience. Many of our surrogates have volunteered to be advocates to speak directly with women thinking about being a surrogate. Our surrogates’ stories have also been featured in their local news including: Andrea Brenes in Miami Mom Collective’s One Amazing Mama Shares Why She Became a Surrogate, Kristi Graves in How To Become a Surrogate in Denver and Briana Buck in Charlotte Mom of Two Earns $52,000 As A Surrogate. Learn more about what inspires women to become a surrogate, factors that play into her decision to give the gift of family and what matters most to her throughout her surrogacy journey in How To Decide To Become A Surrogate Mother. What are the requirements to be a surrogate? The most important requirements are quite basic: she must have given birth before and she must be a US citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Check out Surrogate Medical Requirements FAQs to review the basic qualifications and find answers to frequently asked questions about becoming a surrogate. The Age Limit for Surrogate Mothers outlines why age is such an important factor in becoming a surrogate. Many women also want to know if they can become a surrogate after a tubal ligation. Find out why having a tubal ligation can actually be advantageous for a woman in a surrogacy journey. We encourage all women who feel they have been called to become a surrogate to learn about the full process of How To Become A Surrogate Mother. Learn more about why does someone become a surrogate. How Do Surrogates Find Intended Parents? Choosing the right surrogacy agency provides a surrogate with proper compensation, legal and financial support, and protection throughout their surrogacy journey. Partnering with an experienced surrogate agency prevents a surrogate from experiencing hardships and pitfalls that can occur in a surrogacy journey, especially when a surrogate is choosing to partner with the family she was meant to help. Matching with the right family is a top priority for a surrogate. A surrogate is a partner in the surrogacy process. Through our Matching Matters™, ConceiveAbilities takes into consideration personal preferences to help pair a surrogate with the perfect family for her that has shared expectations and values. A surrogate is bravely giving the gift of family and should be focused on what matters most, taking care of herself and her family while carrying the baby. ConceiveAbilities allows surrogates to do that by having a surrogate process in place. Without an agency, much of the paperwork, communication and arrangements fall to the surrogate and are time consuming. ConceiveAbilities ensures a surrogate’s needs are protected. Financially, our surrogacy agency vets and creates financial assurance to secure surrogate compensation and all the resources needed for the surrogacy journey to be a successful one. We provide legal guidance to make sure a surrogate’s rights are met throughout every step of the surrogacy journey. Our agency ensures a surrogate has proper health insurance, medical coverage and life insurance, is fairly compensated, legally protected, and physically and mentally supported throughout every step of a surrogacy journey.

Understanding the surrogacy process is important for a successful journey. There are many myths and misconceptions about surrogacy, including Does a Surrogate Mother Share DNA with the Baby? and Do Surrogates Get Attached To The Baby? Dispelling myths and researching concerns is important to feel comfortable through every step of the surrogacy process. In addition to researching the process of surrogacy, intended parents need a plan to pay for a surrogacy journey. At the outset, that may seem straightforward but it requires a thorough understanding of the full cost of surrogacy. Our All-In Program for intended parents, a first-of-its-kind offering, leverages our 25 years of experience to offer the most comprehensive and risk-free surrogacy program in the market. One of the more important decisions for intended parents is how to create embryos. For instance, an intended mother can choose to harvest her own eggs even after a hysterectomy. Many hopeful parents will need to find a great egg donor. ConceiveAbilities is a pioneer in the egg donor business and has grown into a full family fertility agency by always putting the security of intended parents and egg donors first. From application through retrieval, we make sure each party has the egg donor information needed, including the egg donation timeline, so each party is as informed and empowered as possible.

    "content": "What You Need To Know About COVID-19 and Pregnancy Pregnancy and the COVID-19 vaccination is a hot topic in our fertility world today. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for people age16 and older. The CDC encourages all pregnant people or people who are thinking about becoming pregnant and those breastfeeding to get vaccinated to protect themselves from COVID-19. And the American Society for Reproductive Medicine says while all women should be strongly encouraged to receive COVID-19 vaccination when pregnant or attempting pregnancy, clinics should strongly consider requiring vaccination for gestational carriers and advise intended parents to include the requirement of vaccination of gestational carriers in their contracts. How do you take all of that information and apply it to pregnancy and surrogacy? As we navigate the pandemic and new variants, we’ve been hearing a lot about the questions and concerns from all parties regarding how that impacts surrogates and our intended parents. Dr. Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron, board certified in both Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, with Fertility Centers of Illinois answered our questions about the COVID-19 vaccine and surrogacy on our podcast All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes. Here are our top seven takeaways about COVID-19 and pregnancy from our interview with Dr. Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron. 1: Pregnancy is a risk factor for COVID-19 “Some data has demonstrated increased risk of ICU stays, increased risk of miscarriage, and increased risk of stillbirth. So the virus itself can particularly impact the health of a pregnant woman, which makes it even more pertinent to discuss ways to prevent pregnant women from getting COVID.” 2: Pregnant women are protected by the vaccine “Even with the Delta variant, when you’ve been vaccinated, the risk of hospitalization is still quite low. It’s a pandemic of the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated individuals are the ones getting sick enough that they’re being hospitalized. And the vaccine is the tool we have to prevent it.” 3: The vaccine is >95% effective “Some people who got vaccinated, but still had a positive COVID test, may be frustrated. But if someone’s at home with a cold, that’s not what we’re really worried about. What we’re really worried about is someone being hospitalized or being in the ICU.” 4: The COVID-19 vaccine is safe “About 22 healthcare organizations have supported the vaccine including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and the CDC. As more studies are done and the data accumulates, we’ve become more and more reassured that they continue to support the safety of the vaccine. They do not increase your risk of infertility. They do not worsen the pregnancy. They protect the pregnancy, because the virus is a risk to your pregnancy.” 5: Doctors recommend the COVID-19 vaccination “Our job is to educate people that just like quitting smoking, obtaining a healthy weight, or limiting alcohol, the vaccine is a way that we are making your body as healthy as possible to receive a pregnancy, whether it’s for a “keeper” baby or not.” 6: The vaccine is strongly recommended for surrogates “On a case by case, physicians will approve or discourage a surrogate based on their vaccination status. I can only speak for myself, but I would gather that the vast majority of Reproductive Endocrinologists are going to discourage surrogates that are uncomfortable with the vaccine.” 7: Make your health optimal for a surrogacy journey “It is an incredible gift to consider being a surrogate. I don’t want to minimize it for one second and to now take that next step to say, what can I proactively do to make my health optimal in this pandemic and the pregnancy optimal. The vaccine is in that category. I implore everyone out there who’s concerned about safety to ask their physician. Ask them to review the data. Ask them pointedly the questions and the concerns that you personally have and use good information to make a good decision.” A Note from our CEO and Founder “When surrogates come to the decision to embark on a surrogacy journey, they’re helping families that have been through struggle, after struggle, after struggle. And what they’re looking for more than anything is to partner with a like-minded surrogate who gives them the best, healthiest chance for creating the family of their dreams and for that healthy baby. Rarely do I take such an extreme stance on a topic in these podcasts, but the physicians here are the experts. Consider the risks for you and the baby that you may be carrying or will be caring for an intended parent and put your best foot forward on behalf of that family, so that they can have their dreams fulfilled and you can be safe. Roll up your sleeves and get that vaccination.”Nazca Fontes Why Must Surrogates With ConceiveAbilities Be Vaccinated Against COVID-19 As your surrogacy agency, your health and well being is our top priority. We are here to help you navigate your surrogacy journey in every way possible. COVID-19 presents significant risks to surrogates and babies and puts intended parents’ dreams of a family in jeopardy. Following reputable medical recommendations for standard of care for pregnant women and our fertility clinic medical partners’ protocol, surrogates with ConceiveAbilities must be vaccinated to embark on a surrogacy journey. Many of our fertility clinics are following these recommendations and will not clear an unvaccinated surrogate to move forward in a surrogacy journey. This is time and effort lost for you and the intended parents if concerns about COVID-19 vaccination ultimately end in a failed surrogacy journey. We know that for you to move forward in a timely, healthy and productive manner, you will need to be vaccinated. Medical and life insurance companies are not insuring unvaccinated surrogates for illness and deaths associated with COVID-19, putting you and your family’s well being at risk. Gestational carriers who are unvaccinated are not only risking their own health, but are significantly risking the health of the intended parents’ child. While we respect the autonomy of people to make decisions regarding their own health, the gestational carrier has a unique status as the child they are carrying is not their own and not being vaccinated puts someone else’s child at risk. We acknowledge vaccination may not be the path forward for you and thank you for considering becoming a surrogate with ConceiveAbilities. The best way to get information about the COVID-19 vaccine is to talk with your doctor. There are many resources available to help answer your questions and prepare you to ask more questions of your doctor including a recent study of more than 17,000 pregnant women. We stand ready to assist you. Are you a woman who was enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate? Talk to us to learn more about the possibilities to help someone else’s dream come true.

    "content": "For a surrogate, her surrogacy pregnancy is different from her other pregnancies and will most likely be her first experience with the IVF process. At ConceiveAbilities, our Life Simplicity Promise ensures each surrogate fully understands the IVF process and is comfortable with every step. Medically, a surrogate goes through the same steps as any woman who undergoes IVF treatment. Because the embryo has no genetic relation to the surrogate, it is implanted in her womb through the IVF process and her body needs to be prepared for implantation by taking medications and hormones like progesterone and estrogen to prepare her body for the embryo transfer. The fertility clinic will provide direction on the surrogate’s specific medication protocol, such as hormone injections, and it will vary from one fertility clinic to another. Watch Fertility Expert Dr. Mark Leondires of the Illume Fertility Clinic explain the embryo transfer process. STEPS FROM MATCH TO EMBRYO TRANSFER As your surrogacy agency, ConceiveAbilities will guide you through every step of your journey. Our team will collaborate with your fertility clinic to ensure all steps are completed. The below checklist will help you keep track of your progress. Please also refer to email communications for more details on each step and do not hesitate to reach out to your team with any questions along the way. Once you are matched, you will complete the financial and medical work necessary to. This included obtaining medical clearance from the fertility clinic, getting the proper insurance in place and completing your gestational carrier agreement. When all of the medical, financial and legal paperwork is complete, you will be cleared for embryo transfer. You will then begin the surrogate IVF process to prepare your body for a surrogate pregnancy. What is the IVF process step by step? After you are cleared for embryo transfer, the fertility clinic will establish a treatment plan and medical protocol detailed and specific to you. Remember, each clinic and each IVF cycle can be different, but this is an example of what an IVF calendar may look like: Step 1: For the first three weeks, many women take birth control to regulate hormone levels and to synchronize her menstrual cycle so that the timing is aligned with the medical protocol. Step 2: The day the woman gets her period is an important step in the IVF process. She will continue to take birth control pills to maintain the regulation of hormones. Step 3: On day 21, she may begin taking medications such as Lupron that will mimic natural ovulation. Step 4: After taking medication for 10 days, she will have an appointment to ensure ovulation has been suppressed. Step 5: She will begin taking medications to grow the lining of the uterus and to help her body prepare for a successful embryo transfer. While the specific approach varies and is customized to each gestational carrier provided by the fertility clinic. Step 6: The embryo transfer! The highest quality embryo that is available to the intended parents is transferred to the gestational carrier to attempt a pregnancy. A pregnancy test can be attempted about two weeks after the transfer. Fertility clinic provides a calendar/protocol specific to the surrogate. ConceiveAbilities sets up local monitoring clinic. Intended Parents contact local monitoring clinic to provide payment information (if 2021 or 2022 All In) Surrogate contacts local monitoring clinic to schedule appointments. ConceiveAbilities will assist with booking surrogate’s travel as needed for the embryo transfer. How long does the IVF process from start to finish? Most frequently, surrogates are on a medication regime for 10-12 weeks. With our All-In Surrogate Care and Compensation Package, she receives comprehensive support from a team of experts. There can be unforeseen circumstances in which the stimulation process takes a bit longer, or may even need to be canceled and restarted the next month if the ovaries are over or under responding to the medical protocol. While your clinic can estimate a general timeframe and will create a calendar for you to follow, it’s important to maintain flexibility, follow instructions precisely, and remember that each cycle is unique.

We know it is a big decision and we value your commitment to help another family achieve their dream of having a child. Surrogates sit at the heart of our program and your health and safety is our top priority. As your surrogacy agency, we are fully invested in your physical and mental health from the beginning of your surrogacy journey through your fourth trimester recovery. Our All-In Surrogate Care & Compensation Package prepares you for a successful surrogacy pregnancy and supports you throughout your journey until you recover. Our comprehensive plan to ensure a successful Fourth Trimester recovery, from the start of your pregnancy and based on The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists standard of care, including Birth preparation and doula care Physical therapy Nutrition Fitness and movement An important part of being prepared for a successful surrogacy pregnancy is being prepared for recovery. After you have delivered the precious baby for your intended family, you will need to recover. OB-GYN and Medical Officer of Women’s Health for the Philadelphia Department of Health, Dr. Aasta Mehta is a proponent of The Fourth Trimester, the period of about 12 weeks after a woman gives birth. While there is no magical number of weeks a woman takes to recover from delivery, Dr. Mehta emphatically says 12 weeks is not enough in our interview The Importance of Fourth Trimester Care with Dr. Aasta Mehta. Three Key Points For Surrogates Planning For Their Fourth Trimester Dr. Mehta answered our questions about the importance of the fourth trimester on our All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes. You can listen to The Full Fourth Trimester Podcast here. 1: Set The Stage For A Strong Fourth Trimester Recovery “You’re never going to be able to predict the hormonal imbalance and how that will impact your mental and physical health, but you should be as prepared as possible. Having a support network in place and having a postpartum plan, such as who’s going to care for the baby at night or during the day if you need a mental health break, is helpful. There are postpartum plans you can find on Google and work with your doctor to decide on a feasible plan for you and your family. A lactation expert, mental health professionals, and pelvic floor physical therapy are just a few who can offer great support. Postpartum doulas can also be a really great support after delivery.” 2: How Does A Surrogate’s Recovery Differ From Her Other Pregnancies? “Some of the stresses of that postpartum fourth trimester do have to do with caring for a child and the emotional impact of that. But certainly, the physiology also lends itself to the surrogate. The difference in emotions and depression is physiological, regardless of not being the care-taker of the child after birth. So that’s something to understand and not feel like, wait, but I don’t even have the baby, why am I depressed? That is a message that I want people to hear, because your hormones are completely changed after birth. I think it is important to recognize that even though you were going into this birth experience knowing this was not your baby, that feeling of emptiness might still be there. Regardless of how prepared you are, that potentially could have an impact and having those supports in place to deal with those types of feelings is important. These feelings are normal and a surrogate should not feel embarrassed if she feels that way. For everyone, not just surrogates, complications can occur in that postpartum period that can lead to cardiovascular conditions like cardiomyopathy and embolism. These things can mimic normal changes in the postpartum period. Being really in tune with your body and what you are feeling and knowing what’s normal and what’s not can make the difference. It’s also helpful to have people around you looking out for you as well. I imagine in surrogacy, your family’s not helping as much, because you don’t need help with a baby. But I think having those loved ones looking out for specific medical complications that could occur, can help.” 3: What Do You Want Women To Know About The Fourth Trimester “Don’t ignore your own health for the benefit of your baby, because you’re only doing harm that way. There’s no actual roadmap for what’s the right way to recover after childbirth. It’s whatever is the right way for you. There’s no time frame on that. It’s okay to feel like you are struggling and to know you can ask for help.” Steps You Can Take To Educate Yourself Below, we’ve outlined some steps you can take to make sure your surrogate pregnancy is a successful one.

We have a great blog from a surrogate husband’s perspective My Wife Is A Surrogate and resources here about the men behind surrogacy that can help you start the conversation. For explaining surrogacy to your children, The Kangaroo Pouch written by Dianne Whitfield is a fantastic book. Maintain a balanced and healthy diet A surrogacy pregnancy is, in some sense, like any other traditional pregnancy: it requires you to look after your body and it’s never too soon to start those habits. To start, Healthy Lifestyle Diet Suggestions For Surrogate Mothers is a good resource. Remove sources of stress Finally, as a surrogate mother, you have the responsibility to create a relaxed and stress-free environment for the child you are carrying. In fact, research shows that stress affects the child’s brain development, so this is a great opportunity to think creatively about about how to lessen stressors in your life. Surrogacy can be a beautiful journey, however, for many first-time surrogates, the uncertainty of the process is a usual source of concern.

    "content": "We are honored whenever a woman chooses to talk with us about becoming a surrogate. And, we have many safeguards in place to help ensure that surrogacy can be a healthy and successful experience for both the surrogate and the baby. During our screening process, ConceiveAbilities takes a holistic approach to all considerations and puts significant investment into a surrogate’s medical and obstetrical history with review by registered nurses. Why does this help our surrogate applicants? 95% of our surrogates are medically cleared by their intended parents’ fertility center, ensuring that we safeguard your time, efforts, and emotions. What are the specific surrogate medical requirements? There are several basic qualifications we first consider when we screen surrogates. The primary requirements to become a surrogate include a “yes” answer to each of these questions: Have you given birth to at least one child? Are you between the ages of 21 to 39 years old? Is your BMI lower than 35, and ideally lower than 30? Did you have uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries? Are you a non-smoker? Do you have stable mental health, with no bouts of severe anxiety or depression? As part of surrogacy process, you will also undergo a medical screening with a fertility specialist to make sure that you able to sustain a pregnancy. All of the records for your previous pregnancies will be reviewed to ensure they were healthy and uncomplicated. You should be upfront about any experiences with preterm labor or miscarriage when applying to become a surrogate. Can I become a surrogate without a previous pregnancy? No. It is a strict requirement that surrogates have carried at least one of their own children to term in a healthy pregnancy. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine includes this in their guidelines for surrogacy and it will be a requirement with any reputable surrogacy agency, fertility clinic, and reproductive endocrinologist. What medical conditions can disqualify you to be a surrogate mother? ConceiveAbilities will do a thorough review of your medical and obstetrical history, conducted by registered nurses, to ensure a surrogacy journey can be healthy and successful for you, along with the baby you would carry. We consider everything from the health of your heart, to the health of your reproductive organs, to the health of your endocrine system, and more. Agencies, and the fertility clinics they work with, can vary in what medical conditions disqualify a surrogate applicant. Your doctor is also a valuable resource to advise you on your specific circumstances. With that said, there are several conditions which may disqualify you from becoming a surrogate mother. HIV can be transmitted to the baby during pregnancy or birth, so surrogates cannot test positive for HIV. Preeclampsia in previous pregnancies leads to a higher likelihood in later pregnancies. The high blood pressure and kidney damage that come with preeclampsia present a health risk to the surrogate and the baby. Ablation destroys a part of your uterine lining, which makes a successful implantation more unlikely. It also increases the risk of miscarriage if you do become pregnant and will disqualify you from becoming a surrogate. PCOS impacts the likelihood of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and other health risks which can impact your ability to carry a baby. Your doctor can best determine the impacts of PCOS on a potential pregnancy, but PCOS may disqualify you from becoming a surrogate depending on the severity. Endometriosis can make it harder to become pregnant and increase health risks to the baby if you do become pregnant. Since the severity of endometriosis varies, it’s important to seek the guidance of a doctor on how this might impact your surrogacy journey. This is not an all-inclusive list, and there are unique medical considerations for many surrogate applicants. If you have questions, ConceiveAbilities and your doctor can educate you about how your medical conditions may impact your qualifications to become a surrogate. I’ve had healthy pregnancies. Why all of these considerations? Becoming pregnant through IVF is different than getting pregnant without intervention. The process is medically intricate, delicate, and precisely synchronized. Adherence to FDA and industry guidelines is required to maximize success of embryo implantation into your uterus. Hormone level and uterine environment have to be “just right” for an embryo to be successfully implanted. Can you become a surrogate if your tubes are tied? Yes. Since ConceiveAbilities is a gestational surrogacy agency, the egg used will always be from the intended mother or an egg donor. Getting your tubes tied, or a tubal ligation, works by stopping your own ovulation. It doesn’t impact the ability to transplant an embryo into your uterus successfully. Read more here. Can you be a surrogate after a c-section? Yes. We can accept applicants with previous caesarean sections. It is important to discuss any past C-sections with your doctor to determine the potential impacts they may have on surrogacy. Can you be a surrogate after menopause? No. We have an age requirement that all surrogates must generally be younger than 40 years of age and typically menopause occurs after this age. By nature, menopause is your body letting you know the reproductive period of your life has ended. Even if you are post-menopausal and meet this age requirement, becoming pregnant after menopause is highly unlikely and presents many risks to a successful surrogacy journey. Can you be a surrogate if you have HPV? Yes. We require the additional documentation of your colposcopy results if you are HPV positive. In the majority of cases, HPV does not impact the healthy development of a baby. It can be transmitted to the baby if you are experiencing an outbreak of genital warts, which is one of the most common side effects of HPV, during birth. If this is the case, you should be prepared to give birth via C-section. Can you be a surrogate if you have high blood pressure? Generally, no. High blood pressure increases the risk of preeclampsia and other pregnancy risks. It can decrease blood flow to the placenta, which may lead to low birth weight or premature birth. It can also lead to the slower growth of the baby or injury to your own major organs. Hypertension is linked to many health risks, if uncontrolled, for both you and a developing baby. Can you be a surrogate mother if you or your children are not vaccinated? ConceiveAbilities welcomes applicants who represent a wide range of backgrounds, values, and beliefs. We understand that there are many viewpoints surrounding vaccination and do not disqualify surrogate applicants based on whether they or their families are vaccinated. We get to know our applicants to facilitate a perfect match and supportive relationship from the start, so during your screening you should plan to discuss your beliefs and reasoning about vaccinations. ConceiveAbilities will work with you to navigate how this may impact your path to becoming a surrogate. Reputable surrogacy agencies like ConceiveAbilities have years of experience crafting their medical requirements for surrogates with the goal of increasing chances of a successful surrogacy journey. The health of you, the surrogate, and the baby throughout surrogacy is our top priority, so we uphold strict medical standards, developed with the considerations of fertility clinics.

We ask that our surrogates must: Have a BMI below 35, and ideally below 30 Be a non-smoker living in a non-smoking home Have no history of severe anxiety, depression or other mental illnesses 3) You are the right age We look for surrogates between the age range of 21 and 39 years old, although surrogacy may be a viable option for women into their early 40s. Surrogates must be at least 21 years old to help ensure the necessary level of emotional maturity and responsibility to enter into the significant undertaking that is surrogacy. 4) You have already given birth to your own child(ren) This standard is included in guidance from the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) for gestational carriers and, practically speaking, is a requirement of all leading fertility clinics. Your prenatal and delivery records, indicating a history of uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries, will be required. Do not worry, our surrogate engagement team helps to track all required records down for you. 5) You are a good communicator Part of being an awesome surrogate is just keeping everyone in the loop. During certain phases of your journey you will be asked to consistently check in with the agency and your intended parents. Timely and consistent communication will mean the world to your Intended Parents and thanks to our matching methodology, you should find it easy to communicate with one another. 6) You are financially stable Reputable agencies, such as ConceiveAbilities, only work with women who are in a stable financial position. We work with you to ensure that your lifestyle is conducive to a healthy and low stress pregnancy. We consider multiple factors to determine financial stability and typically no one factor, such as whether you receive government assistance, is disqualifying. Our surrogate engagement team will work through specific questions with you regarding this or any other qualification as part of reviewing your registration form and getting to know you. 7) You are tenacious Some journeys are as easy as pie: the surrogate becomes pregnant on the first transfer attempt, everyone is thrilled and there are no bumps along the way. While some journeys are like that, not all are. Sometimes there are bumps, disappointments, slowdowns, small challenges, or miscommunications along the way. A good surrogate is someone who can take it all in stride and focus on the bigger picture of the awesome thing she is doing for another family. She will, of course, have her fellow surrogates, her monthly mental health support group leader, dedicated Match Manager, and many other resources to help her through along the way. 8) You have a clean background Simply put, you must not have any history of criminal activity or any significant pending legal disputes or credit problems. You get it. You are going to be carrying someone’s baby. They want to know that you make good choices. If you have a small or very distant infraction on your record and are unsure of whether it is disqualifying, we will discuss that with you as we review your registration form. 9) You are supported by your friends and family A surrogacy journey is work. There can be challenges. You will need a strong support system to help you along the way. If your friends and families are the type to support you at every turn, or if they already understand and respect your surrogacy decision, you’ll be all the better surrogate for having their support. It is important to note that you do not have to be married or in a relationship to become a surrogate. Your support system could come from your family, friends, or your “tribe”. 10) You want to join the sisterhood When you become a surrogate, you not only become a part of a movement, you also join a community of other women who become your surrosisters. These women are there for you throughout your journey. You share in one another’s highs and lows. You support one another, meet up for support groups and it is often the case that you remain close friends long after you have delivered as a surrogate. In the end, your decision to become a surrogate is one that we will strive to make together, considering and balancing many factors but focused, in the end, only on whether surrogacy can be a healthy and successful experience for you. Surrogacy can be an exhilarating journey. Few things can compare to the feeling of being responsible for another family’s happiness.

At the time, a rep for the actress confirmed that “Lucy Liu is the proud mother of Rockwell Lloyd Liu, brought into the world via gestational carrier.” PHOTO: SPLASHNEWS.COM Kristen Wiig and Avi Rothman The Bridesmaids star and her fiancé are proud new parents! The couple first announced that they were engaged in August 2019, and welcomed their children in early 2020 via surrogate. While hosting a Mother’s Day special for Saturday Night Live in May, the actress coyly thanked her own mother for preparing her “to be a mom,” which left viewers scratching their heads until the happy news was confirmed one month later. PHOTO: ANDERSON COOPER/INSTAGRAM Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper became a father to his son Wyatt via surrogate on April 27, 2020. Wyatt, who is named after the journalist’s father, “is sweet, and soft, and healthy and I am beyond happy,” the proud new dad announced on CNN. “As a gay kid, I never thought it would be possible to have a child, and I’m grateful for all those who have paved the way, and for the doctors and nurses and everyone involved in my son’s birth,” Cooper shared along with a touching series of photos of Wyatt. He went on to praise the woman who carried his son for the past 9 months, saying that, “Most of all, I am grateful to a remarkable surrogate who carried Wyatt, and watched over him lovingly, and tenderly, and gave birth to him.” “It is an extraordinary blessing – what she, and all surrogates give to families who can’t have children,” he said. “My surrogate has a beautiful family of her own, a wonderfully supportive husband, and kids, and I am incredibly thankful for all the support they have given Wyatt and me. My family is blessed to have this family in our lives.” PHOTO: BENJAMIN MADDEN/INSTAGRAM Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden After over five years of trying to conceive using IVF, acupuncture, and supplements, in January 2020 Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden confirmed that they had welcomed their daughter, Raddix, via surrogate. According to a close source, “Cameron feels like this baby is truly a miracle,” and she “wants to spend every second with the baby.” PHOTO: KANDI BURRUSS/INSTAGRAM Kandi Burruss and Todd Tucker The Real Housewives of Atlanta star and her husband, Todd Tucker, welcomed a baby girl, Blaze, via gestational carrier in November 2019. When asked about the decision to use a surrogate, Burruss said, “Now that it’s all said and done, I wouldn’t change a thing. It was the best decision that we could have made.” When it came to giving advice to anyone else considering IVF and/or surrogacy, Burruss said, “I would definitely say go forward. The research is the main thing. And then you just gotta trust and believe and just go for it.” PHOTO: RICKY MARTIN/INSTAGRAM Ricky Martin and Jwan Yosef The couple welcomed their fourth child, Renn Martin-Yosef, via surrogate in October 2019. On October 29, Martin shared on Instagram, “Nuestro hijo Renn Martin-Yosef ha nacido,” which translates to “our son Renn Martin-Yosef was born.” The little boy joined older sister Lucia and twin sons Valentino and Matteo to complete the happy family of six! PHOTO: ANDY COHEN/INSTAGRAM Andy Cohen On the Dec. 20, 2018 episode of Bravo’s Watch What Happens Next Live, the executive producer and host, 50, revealed he’s expecting his first child via surrogate. He told viewers that “family means everything to me and having one of my own is something that I have wanted in my heart for my entire life.” On Feb. 4, 2019, he shared the happy news of son Benjamin Allen’s arrival. “I’m in love,” he wrote on Instagram alongside a blissful shot of the two of them together. PHOTO: GABRIELLE UNION-WADE/INSTAGRAM Gabrielle Union-Wade and Dwayne Wade In November 2018, the actress and her NBA star husband surprised fans when they revealed that they had secretly welcomed a baby girl via surrogate, daughter Kaavia James. The couple announced their daughter’s birth on Instagram, as Union, who previously opened up about her fertility struggles, announced that “we are sleepless and delirious but so excited to share that our miracle baby arrived last night via surrogate.” She went on to say, “11/7 will forever be etched in our hearts as the most loveliest of all the lovely days. Welcome to the party sweet girl! #onelastdance #skintoskin @dwyanewade.” PHOTO: KIM KARDASHIAN WEST/INSTAGRAM Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West Kanye and wife hired a surrogate to carry their third child, Chicago, and did it again for baby No. 4, PEOPLE confirmed in January 2019. “We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care,” the reality star wrote on her website after the January 2018 birth of Chicago. Giving birth again isn’t an option for Kardashian West, who suffered from placenta accreta during both of her pregnancies with son Saint and daughter North. PHOTO: JIMMY FALLON/INSTAGRAM Jimmy Fallon and Nancy Juvonen The late-night talk show host and his wife have had two daughters via surrogacy. Their first daughter, Winnie, was born in 2013, and they welcomed a second baby girl, Frances, in 2014. Over the years, Fallon and his wife have been very open about their fertility issues. “It’s hard if you can’t have children. We struggled for a good five years trying to have a kid.” After the birth of their first daughter, Fallon went on to explain, “We tried a bunch of things. Anyone who’s tried will know, it’s just awful,” he said. “So, we had a surrogate.” Fallon’s road to fatherhood wasn’t an easy one, and he insists, “If there’s anyone out there who is trying and they’re just losing hope, just hang in there.” He suggests to, “Try every avenue; try anything you can do, because you’ll get there. You’ll end up with a family, and it’s so worth it. It is the most ‘worth it’ thing.” PHOTO: NEIL PATRICK HARRIS/INSTAGRAM Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka’s children arrived with help from both an egg donor and a surrogate back in 2011. “We found an egg donor anonymously through a hilarious process of looking at people’s profiles and then an amazing surrogate who had helped a same-sex couple before,” Harris described, “And then we inserted two eggs, one with my sperm, one with David’s sperm and they both took!” Burtka has previously noted that the couple “don’t know whose is whose.”Surrogacy has made considerable progress in the past twenty years from a medical and legal perspective. For some states like Illinois, gestational surrogacy was only legally protected in the past decade. Today, many stereotypes and stigmas associated with surrogacy are becoming outdated. PHOTO: Nicole Kidman Nicole Kidman Actress Nicole Kidman already had three children prior to her surrogacy journey. In December 2010, she revealed that her fourth child, Faith Margaret, was gestated by a surrogate in the United States (due to restrictive surrogacy laws in her native Australia). “Our family is truly blessed, and just so thankful, to have been given the gift of baby Faith Margaret,” she and her husband said in a statement. “No words can adequately convey the incredible gratitude that we feel for everyone who was so supportive throughout this process, in particular our gestational carrier.” PHOTO: Giuliana Rancic Giuliana Rancic E! News Host Giuliana Rancic discovered she had breast cancer after a few IVF cycles and a miscarriage. Her cancer treatment meant that she had to use surrogacy as a means to starting her family. Finally, she and her husband welcomed a son, Edward Duke, who was born in 2012 via a surrogate named Delphine. Unfortunately, their attempts to have a second child resulted in miscarriages. “Bill and I are blessed beyond words to welcome Edward into our lives,” Giuliana said to E! News. “Thank you so much to everyone who supported us along the way.” PHOTO: Elizabeth Banks Elizabeth Banks Actress Elizabeth Banks also struggled to grow her family before turning to surrogacy. Today she and her husband have two children, Felix and Magnus, both by a surrogate. In a 2012 interview in Women’s Health, Banks discussed how she moved past having someone else carry her baby for her: “Once my focus became the baby and not the pregnancy, it was a very easy decision.” “Like Felix, Magnus was born via gestational surrogate. This experience has exceeded all expectations, taught us a great deal about generosity and gratitude, and established a relationship that will last a lifetime,” Banks told People Magazine.

    "content": "You may have decided that surrogacy is right for you. You’ve done the research, you’ve spoken to your friends, your family, and your physician. Now is the time to choose a reputable surrogacy agency. As Dr. Daniel Shapiro, of Reproductive Biology Associates, shares the minefield of sifting through all the disparate information online to make a decision. He suggests that an agency that knows the players and has high quality experience is the place to start. While thousands of families have chosen ConceiveAbilities because of our values, experience, and staff, we hope to help your research by providing a set of criteria and important questions you can use as you consider the best surrogacy agency for you. Hopefully, you will feel better equipped with the knowledge of what separates the best surrogacy agencies from all others. Reputation How many years has the agency been in business? What do other people say about the business? What does the agency say about themselves? Start your research by learning about the reputation of different agencies. What does their brand and website represent about them? What kind of accomplishments or awards have they earned? Do they adhere to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines for surrogacy? Remember to check reviews on Facebook, Google, and other social media websites. Thoroughly read the comments left by parents and surrogates explaining their rating. Expertise What is the screening process like? Who works there? Do they partner with fertility centers? Who are the experts involved in evaluating a gestational carrier’s suitability? It’s important to listen to the conversation around an agency, and it’s equally important to research the actual work the agency does. Start with their screening process and surrogate requirements. What criteria does the agency use in selecting their surrogates? A successful surrogacy journey hinges greatly on the quality of the surrogates and how an agency treats both surrogates and intended parents alike. Try checking the company’s LinkedIn page to learn more about the work history of Match Managers, the executive team, and other key personnel. Surrogacy requires skills and experience and you want to be sure you’re working directly with people who have a complete understanding of the industry and the process. Value What protections are in place for both parents and surrogates? How comprehensive is their team? How much do they insource rather than outsource? There are a lot of resources that go into an effective surrogacy journey, so the best decision may not always be the seemingly cheapest option. Rather, you should question the value of the agency’s services. The best surrogacy agencies will walk you through every expense, and explain the reason behind the cost. Transparency is important. With so many options, choosing the best surrogacy agency is a matter of choosing the best one for you and your family. If you’re a surrogate, you want to partner with an agency that protects you and values you. If you’re a parent, the right agency will match you with the right surrogate and help you come home with a new member of the family. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate?

    "content": "Over the past twenty-five years, Chicago has cemented its reputation as a fertility hub in the minds of both international and US citizens alike. Just as San Francisco is home to the tech startup industry, and Los Angeles is known for the movie business, Chicago is becoming synonymous with the fertility industry. So what factors are at hand here? What has led to the popularity of surrogacy in Chicago? Today we explore the factors responsible for shaping the Windy City into the family-building hub that it is today. 1: Chicago Fertility Clinics Did you know that Chicago is home to some of the country’s leading fertility experts? It’s true. Chicago boasts a sizable number of elite clinics. And although ConceiveAbilities is proud to work with all of our esteemed clinic partners who are scattered throughout the United States, there certainly is something fun about being able to claim so many of these distinguished institutions and professionals as close neighbors.Learn more about our clinic partners here. 2: ConceiveAbilities Established in 1996 ConceiveAbilities was started in Chicago, Illinois, in 1996. We don’t want to brag, but it’s no coincidence to us that for over twenty-five years, ConceiveAbilities has remained at the forefront of helping folks in the Chicago area, and well beyond, build their families. And although we now have offices in New York, Denver, Atlanta, Houston and many other locations, our oldest roots are in Chicago. 3: Surrogacy-Friendly Laws The state laws in Illinois provide one of the most “surrogacy-friendly” environments in the entire United States. Illinois is one of the best places for your surrogacy arrangements because Illinois surrogacy laws provide protective and considerate guardrails for the safety and well-being of all involved parties. It is no wonder that people flock to Illinois for their family building.Learn more about Illinois surrogacy law here. 4: Convenient Airports Unlike some other locations, Chicago seems to have the traveler in mind. With both O’Hare and Midway as airport options, travelers can expect plentiful flights at reasonable costs. The direct international flights to Chicago make life a little bit easier for Intended Parents who may be racing to meet their surrogate and baby in the delivery room. 5: Community of Support Chicago is lucky to have not only a large number of licensed mental health professionals who specialize in fertility but also several well-established meetup groups and nonprofits devoted to providing support for those suffering from infertility.Learn more about the Chicago area peer-led support groups offered through RESOLVE on their website. Learn more about Shine, a nonprofit organization that supports women through their fertility journey by providing free mentorship, support, and education to empower and promote a proactive approach to fertility and women’s health. Calling All Surrogates Are you a woman in Chicago, Illinois, the midwest, or anywhere else in the United States who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate?

    "content": "As Father’s Day approaches, we’d like to shift our attention to the many intended fathers who are looking forward to adding a little bundle of joy to their families! Father’s Day is an important day to celebrate these men throughout the various stages of their surrogacy journeys, as well as those who have not yet begun their journeys. We are so happy to celebrate intended fathers across the world! This Father’s Day is especially special for one of our own ConceiveAbilities’ fathers, Harrison Katzen, who recently welcomed baby boy Jonathan with his wife, Ashley. Harrison and Ashley always knew they wanted to have a child, but shortly after they began dating, Ashley had to tell Harrison that she wouldn’t be able to have children. Diagnosed at a young age with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH), a disorder that occurs in females and mainly affects the reproductive system, Ashley struggled with the knowledge of the emotional and physical difficulties it would take for her to deliver a baby. In Ashley’s case, MRKH meant that while she still carried eggs, her body didn’t develop a uterus or cervix. Knowing the anxiety that Ashley felt in sharing this information to him, Harrison took the news in stride. As the couple discussed options to build their family, surrogacy came up in conversation and started their adventure into parenthood. We recently had the opportunity to catch up with Harrison about his family’s surrogacy journey, and we chatted with him about how he’ll be spending his very first Father’s Day! A Father’s Surrogacy Journey ConceiveAbilities: When did Ashley first tell you about her diagnosis of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) and what were your initial thoughts? Harrison: Ashley first told me about her diagnosis a few months into us dating. I vividly remember the conversation in our apartment as Ashley was understandably very nervous to tell me about it. I can only imagine falling in love with someone who you want to marry and spend your life with, and then being paralyzed by the fear of potentially losing that person due to something completely out of your control. It was a lot to take in at once to be honest. My first thought was with Ashley, and the emotional duress that she had endured thus far in her life. In addition to the physical pain from the rehabilitation, the mental anguish that she had to experience at such a young age was terrible. I then realized that I needed to educate myself on surrogacy and what our path forward would be to have a family. The thing that made it easier to understand was Ashley’s capability to clearly explain that we DID have the ability to create a family via surrogacy. ConceiveAbilities: What types of conversations did you have surrounding building a family that led to choosing surrogacy? Harrison: We are both family-oriented people and knew that we wanted to have children of our own. Ashley knew what our path forward would be, so for me, I just needed to educate myself on what surrogacy would entail, the challenges we would face, and what would be required for us to bring a child into his world. We talked about the importance of finding the right agency to work with, as well as deciding what things were going to be deal breakers for us in the process. I knew that this was our option to have a family and that it was important to embrace that fact. As opposed to being upset or doubting ourselves, I chose to look at the unique path that we would have in creating our family. ConceiveAbilities: Walk us through your decision process to work with ConceiveAbilities. Harrison: When we started the agency search process it was a little daunting – and even similar to dating! We met with representatives from various agencies and got to know their process. By the time we met a representative from ConceiveAbilities and learned about their unique process, we knew immediately they were the most professional organization we had spoken with and that we would be using them to help us find our surrogate. Once we reached this milestone, Ashley and I felt so much better because we knew we were on our way! ConceiveAbilities helped us navigate the search of finding a surrogate and what was especially helpful was that we had a dedicated counselor who helped us figure out what was most important to us in finding our surrogate. There are difficult decisions that each family must make as to what is most important. Our counselor was there for us, answering every question we had and helping us to navigate through that initial period. A few months later we heard back from our counselor that they had a potential surrogate whom they thought was the right match for us. We set up an interview and spoke with Jenna and her husband for an hour or so, getting to know them, what their priorities were, her pregnancy experiences, and why she was doing this. We had an amazing first meeting and then spoke with our counselor about what would be the next steps. Our counselor informed us that we had 24 hours to make a decision if we wanted to move forward with Jenna as our surrogate. At the time, we were overwhelmed. Jenna was the first potential surrogate we had been introduced to, and we couldn’t understand why we had to make a decision so quickly, nor why we weren’t allowed to meet another potential surrogate during that time. Looking back, it’s a testament to the process that ConceiveAbilities has implemented. The 24-hour rule, as I’ll call it, is done for both the protection of the intended parent as well as the surrogate. This is an emotional process and there was a lot of thought put into implementing this policy from a mental wellness perspective. After discussing the decision in front of us, we knew Jenna was the right fit. ConceiveAbilities: Did you know right away that Jenna was the right surrogate for you and Ashley? Harrison: We instantly knew that Jenna was an amazing human being! Meeting your surrogate is similar to dating, and so meeting your surrogate initially over Zoom can be tough. You are taking a huge leap and naturally there are feelings of wanting to make sure you make the right decision because it is so important. Jenna was the first surrogate that we met, and the only reason I think we did not know immediately if she was the right person for us is that we had no frame of reference. Jenna is family to Ashley and I now. We experienced a unique connection with her, and her family. They have been such a blessing to us. Our son is truly a miracle baby and we have Jenna to thank for that! We have so much gratitude for what she has done for Ashley and I; it’s very difficult to put into words. Saying thank you to someone who has provided us with the ability to have a family of our own is an understatement to say the least. We are forever indebted to the sacrifices she made for us and she will always be dear in all of our hearts. Welcoming Baby Jonathan ConceiveAbilities: Jonathan’s birth story didn’t quite go as planned. How did you feel when you got the phone call from Jenna’s husband? Harrison: That was a crazy experience! We had already made the decision to travel to Minnesota when Jenna was 37 weeks, before the scheduled birth date. Our son was a few days ahead of schedule in terms of growth and we just had a feeling he would be coming early. What we didn’t know was how early he would come! The night before we were set to fly out there, I got a late-night call from Jenna’s husband, Tony, who explained that Jenna was experiencing heavy contractions and had been admitted into the hospital. ConceiveAbilities: What emotions did you experience being long-distance during Jonathan’s birth and what was it like watching his birth via FaceTime? How was your journey as an intended parent impacted by this change in your birth plan? Harrison: I was really sad at first because I knew how important it was for Ashley to be there for the birth of our son. She felt as though she had been robbed of the experience of being able to carry our child on her own and she wasn’t going to miss the birth because that was all we had. That feeling is completely natural and expected – but I want to let all other future intended mothers know to embrace the unexpected. Everyone’s journey is unique and there is no magic path. Once we realized that Jenna was definitely going into labor, we had to quickly adjust our mindset and prepare for the birth of our son. We wanted to be in a positive frame of mind when Jonathan came into this world. And that’s exactly what we did. Watching Jonathan’s birth on FaceTime was such a surreal experience, and it all happened so quickly. Jenna and her husband were simply amazing. They made sure that we experienced the entire birth and our connection to the two of them grew stronger through that experience. Jenna did skin to skin for us in our absence, and her husband cut the umbilical cord which was an honor. The doctors and nurses at the hospital were also so unbelievable. They knew we were missing the birth in person and were so accommodating given the situation. Although it was not our ideal situation, there was so much beauty in that experience and seeing the best in humanity. We were on a flight a few hours later and arrived at the hospital within 12 hours of his birth. It was a wild ride to say the least. ConceiveAbilities: What was it like seeing your son for the very first time? Harrison: It was the happiest day of my life. Other than when I married my wife, of course! The nurses actually videotaped Ashley and I walking into the room so we could remember that experience forever. He was just sleeping so peacefully and it was amazing to be able to hold him in my arms knowing that we had finally completed our journey. ConceiveAbilities: What plans do you have for your first Father’s Day? Harrison: To enjoy the day with my family and to embrace that I have started this new chapter in my life. I just want to hang out with my son, and enjoy this time when he is an infant because it goes by so fast. It will be nice to slow down for the day, that’s for sure! ConceiveAbilities: How has becoming a father changed you? Harrison: I am no longer just responsible for myself. The power of fatherhood comes with true responsibility and that is so empowering. Also, the simple joy of seeing your child smiling back at you fills your heart. Purpose is an important part of living a fulfilled life and there is no greater purpose than providing the best life possible for your children. ConceiveAbilities: What would you tell other hopeful dads who are considering beginning a surrogacy journey? Harrison: It’s important to educate yourself about the entire process and what it entails. Everything from IVF to finding the right agency, to having those hard conversations with your significant other. It’s definitely not an easy journey, but it is so unbelievably rewarding. Make sure that you are dedicated to the process and that you have an open mind. And that not everything will go as planned, because I can attest to the fact that it does not. ConceiveAbilities: Is there anything else you’d like to add? Harrison: I would like to thank the team at ConceiveAbilities for matching us with Jenna who will be in our family forever and also for the professionalism they have shown in our surrogacy journey. There are so many variables and unknowns that it’s impossible to have a certain answer for everything. The process and support system that is in place for intended parents is truly best in class!

    "content": "As Dr. Eve Feinberg of Northwestern Fertility and Reproductive Medicine explains, one in eight couples who tries to conceive is afflicted with infertility, a potentially devastating diagnosis. When you’re trying to have a baby, you’ll hear countless methods and infertility choices that may help you build your family. Many women have had success with a surprising treatment option: Letrozole, a drug commonly used to treat cancer. These are five things you should know about Letrozole for infertility. 1. What is Letrozole? Letrozole, also used under the trade name Famara (Femara), is an oral medication that functions as an aromatase inhibitor. This helps prevent the conversion of androgen to estrogen, effectively suppressing estrogen production. Women who have been diagnosed with hormone-receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer often take the drug after surgery, chemotherapy or radiation to help reduce the risk of cancer returning. Because Letrozole specifically reduces estradiol levels in the body, it caught the attention of reproductive endocrinologists. 2. What does Letrozole do for fertility? In the simplest terms, Letrozole induces ovulation. As estrogen levels drop, the pituitary gland senses this decrease and secretes the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to increase estrogen in an attempt to maintain optimum hormonal balance. By generating FSH, the ovaries are stimulated to grow more follicles. Letrozole boosts this growth and release of eggs in women who are anovulatory, or not ovulating, and can cause superovulation in women who are already able to ovulate. In both cases, it increases the chances of natural conception. Another benefit of Letrozole for fertility? It improves endometrial thickness. 3. Is Letrozole better than Clomid? Among women without PCOS, studies have shown that there is no difference between Letrozole and Clomid, or that Clomid is the superior treatment. Historically, Clomid has been a popular first option to try during fertility treatment, especially for women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). Clomid falls in a class of medication called clomiphene citrate, which lasts in the body for an extended period of time and may actually have a negative effect on cervical mucus and uterine lining. Research is beginning to show that women with PCOS do not respond well to it. For women with PCOS, a 2013 study shared at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine had convincing results. Among 750 women, the cumulative live birth rate was higher with Letrozole (27.5%) as compared with Clomid (19.5%). A study in 2014 showed Letrozole to perform better, with higher live-birth and ovulation rates among infertile women with PCOS. 4. What are side effects of Letrozole? The majority of the data on the side effects of Letrozole come from women who use it as part of a five-year cancer treatment regimen. Most women who use Letrozole for fertility, however, use it for just five days and find, if there are any side effects, they are similar to Clomid treatments. Side effects of Letrozole can include: Hot flashes Headaches Breast tenderness Fatigue Leg cramps Some women also find that infertility drugs that improve ovulation may also result in anxiety, mood swings, and irritability.Importantly, Letrozole cannot be taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Research shows it may cause damage to developing embryos. A 2014 study dedicated to this research found that congenital and chromosomal abnormalities were found in 5 out of 201 (2.5%) of babies conceived with the help of Letrozole, compared to 5 of 171 (2.9%) of babies conceived naturally and 10 of 251 babies (3.9%) conceived with Clomiphene. The conclusion showed no significant difference in the overall rate of congenital malformations for children born to mothers who conceived naturally versus using Letrozole or Clomiphene treatments. 5. What are the treatment protocols for taking Letrozole as a fertility treatment? Candidates for Letrozole are carefully assessed and evaluated and follow specific guidelines for how and when to take Letrozole. You can read more here. When do options such as surrogacy and egg donation come into the fertility picture? Since Letrozole only addresses ovulation, it doesn’t impact other potential root causes of infertility. The odds of achieving a pregnancy are best when both the egg and sperm come from young, healthy sources that have met specific medical criteria. This may mean using an egg donor. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, IVF with a donor egg has a success rate of 52%, which is the highest of any fertility treatment. Higher still is the rate of success with a surrogate. IVF clinics in the US have a surrogacy success rate of about 75%, and that number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. It’s important to understand your options when it comes to infertility treatment. If you’ve considered surrogacy or an egg donor to build your family, contact ConceiveAbilities. Our team is excited to share more information, success stories and support as you make your decision. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family?

    "content": "Today and every day, we celebrate mothers across the world in any stage of their surrogacy journey. However, Mother’s Day can often be an emotional day for women who have not yet been able to achieve their motherhood goals. Thankfully, with the gift of surrogacy, their time is nearing. This Mother’s Day, we share the heartwarming story of intended mother Morgan, her surrogate Chelsea, and their incredible journey together towards motherhood. Meet Morgan and Chelsea New York residents, Morgan and her husband Andy had been trying to conceive for over five years with multiple miscarriages. With setback after setback, including endometriosis, fibroids, several rounds of IVF and failed transfers, they decided to give the surrogacy process a try. Morgan remembers struggling with this decision, even though surrogacy would be giving them what they always wanted… a baby! “You have an idea in your head of what becoming a mom looks like and becoming a parent and a family looks like and when things don’t go according to your plan you feel a sense of disappointment.” So they moved forward with a surrogacy agency. But as they navigated through the process, Morgan found herself questioning whether the agency they initially selected was the right fit for their family. That’s when Morgan and Andy changed gears, chose ConceiveAbilities as their agency, and found that events really started to take off! Enter Chelsea. Chelsea always knew she wanted to help enrich the lives of another couple by becoming a surrogate mother. Previously a Labor and Delivery nurse, she had seen firsthand the struggles couples went through on a daily basis to conceive and have a child. With strong Midwestern values and a desire to help another family, Chelsea decided to move forward with her decision to become a gestational carrier. One night, Chelsea asked her husband if he wanted any more kids; when he answered “no,” she went ahead and put her plan into action! Within three months of working with ConceiveAbilities, Morgan and Chelsea matched! The two couples went through ConceiveAbilities’ Matching Matters process to see if they would click and, clearly, it was a match made in heaven! As they embarked on this surrogacy journey together, the two women became like sisters – talking and texting all the time. Every story has its ups and downs, however, and we recently had the opportunity to chat with Morgan and Chelsea. They reflected on their surrogacy journey together and discussed the process that led to THIS day, the one that has been long awaited for Morgan: her very FIRST Mother’s Day! The Journey Begins ConceiveAbilities: After such a perfect match, your first embryo transfer didn’t go as planned. What was that experience like, and how did you turn it into a positive one? Morgan: My embryo situation wasn’t great because I had used all the good embryos for myself and we only had one viable embryo to use with Chelsea at that point. So, Chelsea and her husband and her mother-in-law came to visit New York and do our transfer, which we were so excited for, but then we found out our embryo didn’t make it through the thaw. I really thought for the first time in my entire journey that this is not meant to be. I’m not meant to be a mom. Chelsea was really the driving force that helped me to understand that everything happens for a reason. Chelsea: I just kept explaining to Morgan that I’m big on timing. The timing was just not right. What if this whole experience was just to get us a little more comfortable with each other before we actually did the procedure to transfer the embryo. ConceiveAbilities: How did COVID affect your surrogacy journey? Morgan: In February 2020, we were able to do a round of IVF just before COVID. Once things opened back up in June, Chelsea came back to New York for our embryo transfer on June 22. Chelsea: Because of COVID, Morgan couldn’t go in with me for the transfer, however, I took pictures the whole time and documented the whole thing for her! Morgan, along with our moms, waited in the car. When we got back to the hotel, my mom asked me how I felt. I told her I was okay, but that I knew I was pregnant… I could just feel it! ConceiveAbilities: What happened after the transfer? Chelsea: Morgan’s birthday is June 29th, so I took a pregnancy test at home because I just knew I was pregnant. My husband thought I should wait to tell her, since we didn’t want to give her false hopes, but it was her birthday and this was all she wanted! So, I sent her a picture of the test and she was screaming!!! It was AWESOME and everything she and I both wanted. ConceiveAbilities: Since you live in different states, how did you stay in touch throughout the pregnancy? Morgan: We went to Missouri for the 20-week scan and got to visit Chelsea’s hometown. They had a welcoming party for us and the whole family was there! That was really, really special, amazing and very unique. We texted every day before that, but our relationship really grew after the 20-week scan, especially since we got to meet her children and get to know her family. There was just a special bond that formed between us from that point on. Chelsea: My family was SO EXCITED for Morgan and Andy! It was just so easy because Morgan and I are close and we communicate well. I took pictures and FaceTimed them for some of the scans. After each ultrasound, I got pictures that I was able to send to her. I didn’t want to leave anything out because my biggest goal after we became pregnant was to make sure that Morgan knew that she was mom and that she knew everything that was going on throughout the pregnancy. Surro-baby Maximus arrives ConceiveAbilities: Could you tell us about your birth story? Chelsea: From about 20 weeks, I told Morgan this baby won’t make it past 37 weeks. I just know myself and my body. Lo and behold, I got induced at 37 weeks because of hypertension. Morgan: We flew out there a few days before the induction to make sure we were able to see Chelsea before she went to the hospital. It was emotional because I knew Chelsea didn’t want us to miss the birth and it was important to her for us to be there. We had the most beautiful experience in the hospital, as it was a very intense and emotionally charged event. ConceiveAbilities: Was it everything you imagined? Chelsea: It was so much more than I imagined. Obviously, I was prepared to have a baby. But my main concern was making sure that Morgan felt like mom. This whole journey was about making sure that she knew that she was mom and felt like mom. I asked the nurse to direct all questions to Morgan and to make sure they included her in every decision. It’s a big experience, and making those calls in the moment is part of it. You’re getting ready to have your baby, so I wanted to make sure she was involved. Morgan: I remember when I started the journey thinking, “Am I going to be bonded to my baby, because I didn’t carry him?” After going through this journey, I believe that’s the biggest misconception about surrogacy. I remembered thinking, “How will my baby know? How will he know I am his mother?” Believe me, they know. And, honestly, there was just something comforting about seeing the woman that just guarded my child with her life for 9 months help to bring him into the world. It was the complete opposite of how I originally expected I would feel. After Maximus was born, we never left Chelsea’s room. The hospital had set up another room for our family of three to move into after the birth, but we wanted to be there with her. You don’t know how you’re going to feel or how the surrogate is going to feel after the baby is born, but Chelsea was so proud and so happy. It was just a love bubble! ConceiveAbilities: What advice would you give intended parents that are starting their own journey? Morgan: I would tell them to not be afraid to take the leap and to explore options of surrogacy. At the end of the day, all of the resources that we exhaust trying to get pregnant are very expensive and taxing on the body. Be open-minded about building your family through surrogacy, because you might be really pleasantly surprised and save yourself the time, money and effort. My second piece of advice is if something doesn’t feel great, it’s probably not a great fit. You know yourself, so listen to your intuition. If you feel like you’re just another number, or being put through like a factory with your profile, it’s probably not right for you. ConceiveAbilities: Morgan, this is going to be your first Mother’s Day – are you planning anything special? Morgan: We are planning just to be together; the three of us. I feel so grateful to finally be a mother, but I’m also feeling for other people that still can’t. I know I won’t forget that feeling, even though I’m on the other side of it. I know that a lot of people are struggling still, and I know what that feels like to want something and feel hopeless. My message to others is to not to give up. Take the pauses and the mental health breaks that you need along the way, but do not give up. You know in your heart and you know what God’s plan will be, and what’s meant to be, will be. If you believe in your heart that you’re meant to be a parent, you will be. ConceiveAbilities: Are there any words of encouragement you’d like to share with anyone considering surrogacy? Chelsea: If you’ve considered becoming a surrogate, do it! Do not hesitate to give someone such an amazing gift! I am so grateful and blessed because of Chelsea. This is by far one of the best things that has happened in my life! ConceiveAbilities: Chelsea, is there any message you would like to send Morgan on her First Mother’s Day? Chelsea: I want to say Happy Mother’s Day! Morgan, if anyone deserves to be a mother, it is you. I know what a great mom Maximus has and I’m so happy for you! You have grown into a strong, fearless mother and you had it in you the whole time. Tough is an understatement for the last year, but I feel like there’s nothing you cannot handle!

    "content": "Ashley Katzen and her husband recently welcomed their first born son to the world. The couple had diligently planned every step of the process and were looking forward to the big day that was quickly approaching. As the saying goes, however, “The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” Jonathan Lawrence Katzen decided he was ready to meet mom and dad two weeks ahead of schedule, surprising everyone with his early arrival! We asked Ashley to share her reflections surrounding her son’s unexpected entrance with us, and here’s what Ashley had to say: “The statement ‘nothing ever goes as planned’ couldn’t be any more true than with our birth story. We were originally scheduled to have a C-section at 39 weeks and were planning to arrive a week in advance to spend some extra time with our surrogate, Jenna, ahead of the delivery date. As the weeks progressed, I kept finding myself talking to my husband about what I envisioned would happen while witnessing the birth of our first born son. We described to one another how unbelievably amazing the experience would be for us. Being present for our son’s birth was absolutely the anticipated peak of our surrogacy journey. At 36 weeks, we made an executive decision to travel to Minnesota at 37 weeks – two full weeks ahead of schedule – based on the evolution of our pregnancy and how it was developing. Exactly one day before our planned flight, my husband received a call from our surrogate’s husband that her water broke. When he gave me this news, my emotions were all over the place… A mix between fear, sadness, disappointment, anger, excitement and happiness washed over me in waves. I could not believe that I’d waited my entire life for this moment and, now, I was going to miss it. My tears and overwhelming panic couldn’t be contained. Everything escalated so quickly from that point on, and before we knew it, we received a FaceTime from our surrogate’s husband indicating that she was going in for a C-section immediately. Thankfully, we were on video chat for the entire birth experience which was truly surreal! We have been so blessed to have matched with such a wonderful woman who nurtured our child until we arrived at the hospital. My husband and I have promised each other that we will teach our son all the different ways a child can come into this world – and that even though he is genetically ours, without Jenna, he wouldn’t be here. It has officially been 6 weeks since we have welcomed our son, Jonathan Lawrence Katzen, earth side and we could not be happier!” Enjoy some pictures that highlight the joy of Ashley’s recent birth experience: And, one more picture of beautiful baby Jonathan tucked in for a snuggle with his mom and dad.

    "content": "At ConceiveAbilities, we work tirelessly to help hopeful people build families which includes identifying those women with the inclination and qualifications to help others by serving as surrogates and egg donors. We strive to be a force for good in the broader field of fertility and partner with others who share these aims. To that end, just in time for Mothers Day 2021, we are so very proud to share our partnership with the Chicago Coalition for Family Building. President and founder, Dr. Eve Feinberg of Northwestern Fertility and Reproductive Medicine and Vice President Dr. Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron of Fertility Centers of Illinois recently sat down with us to share their mission to help make dreams of family-building come true. The Coalition has brought together over 10 Chicago fertility clinics, leading Reproductive Endocrinologists, and many surrogate professionals and agencies including ConceiveAbilities to help support one mission: to provide financial assistance to individuals or couples who are struggling to afford fertility treatment or adoption. To date, the Coalition has given 92 grants with 46 live births to date. In 2021, the Coalition anticipates giving out 21 grants, which will be its biggest year so far, which includes the Deborah Frank Memorial Grant. Deborah Frank, unfortunately, lost her life to uterine cancer. Her family set up a fund to help others who want to become parents in her honor and provides up to $50,000 for an individual or family embarking on a surrogacy journey. This grant helps couples with costs including medical fees to create a healthy embryo through in-vitro fertilization, agency fees to find the surrogate, a stipend for the surrogate herself, and fees for psychological assessments, legal work, insurance, and escrow fees. If you are using a gestational carrier to build your family and live in Illinois or the surrounding states, hear from Dr. Feinberg more about the Deborah Frank Memorial Grant. If you are a member of the Chicagoland Jewish community, you may be eligible for the grants funded by the Jewish United Fund. In addition to the surrogacy grant, Dr. Feinberg also told us about family building grants that are also available to help defray costs of infertility treatments. The Chicago Coalition for Family Building is accepting applications for all grants now through June 1, 2021. Learn more about the grants available and how to apply here. And, perhaps as the most important gift in helping others who need assistance to build their family do so, if you are a woman that is interested in being a surrogate, please consider applying today. We are thankful for the women who choose to be gestational carriers every day. In tribute to the women who give the gift of family on this Mother’s Day 2021, ConceiveAbilities has made a generous donation to the Deborah Frank Memorial Grant.",

    "content": "One of the most important relationships a woman has in her life is her relationship with her Ob-Gyn doctor. We have hopeful and silly conversations as well as tough and scary conversations with our doctors. When a woman is deciding to become a surrogate, she looks to her trusted obstetrician for their guidance and expert advice. Dr. Heather Carlson with the Mankato clinic has cared for surrogates and delivered many surro-babies in her 15 years servicing her community. Nazca Fontes, founder of ConceiveAbilities and host of the All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast, talked with Dr. Carlson about her experiences working with surrogates and, along the way, did a bit of myth-busting. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take on Dr. Carlson’s perspective. NF: How important is research for your patients who are considering surrogacy?“So many of my patients are already so well-informed because of the research they have already done. They just want to know that I’m going to be there, that I’m going to support them, and that they are my patient. Our relationship is key to the process that even with all of these folks involved in a surrogacy journey and these hopeful and joyful intended parents, the bond between the surrogate and her doctor is really paramount. And it does set the tone for a positive journey.” NF: What are two considerations that you think are at the forefront of surrogates’ minds?“Everyone obviously considers how they would feel giving this baby up. They are very well aware it’s not their baby, but it is important for them to think about how they would feel delivering the baby to the parents after feeling the baby grow inside of them. Most people have already gone through that thought process before they’ve talked to me, but we do talk about that a little bit more because I’ve learned it is important for them to be emotionally prepared that they are just carrying the baby. Secondly, it’s their body, but their body’s on rent in a way. A lot of the medical decision-making isn’t going to be solely based on their wishes necessarily. It’s definitely a conversation between them and the biological parent. Understanding how they are going to deal with that aspect is imperative. Some patients are not going to deal with that as well, because they’re very independent. Other people are better at compartmentalizing that decision and understanding that it is a surrogacy decision versus one that they would make if they were pregnant with their own child.” NF: Let’s bust some surrogacy myths. Right? Some folks second guess surrogates’ intentions. In your experience, why do you think women want to become surrogates?“Surrogates want to help others become a mom or a family. What I probably hear the most often is, ‘My pregnancy was never difficult or hard for me, and I can’t imagine not being able to have children. I feel like I would be a good person to give that to someone else.’ I think that is true for my patients and very admirable.” NF: Another myth is about tubal ligation. Some gestational carriers have heard they can’t be a surrogate if they have had their tubes tied. Is this true?“No, it doesn’t matter because they’re not using their eggs. As long as they have a uterus that’s working and capable of carrying a child, they can be a surrogate.” NF: A big myth that swirls around for folks who don’t know how surrogacy works is the misconception about genetics. Will the baby have any shared DNA with a surrogate mother or look like the surrogate? Let’s bust this one out.“The baby’s genetics have nothing to do with the surrogate. The only way the baby may look like the surrogate is if the mom or dad of the child look similar, but it’s not genetic. It has nothing to do with the surrogate who is merely incubating that baby for that time. So no, no shared DNA.” NF: If you had one piece of advice for anyone considering surrogacy, what would it be?“Ask yourself, “Why do I want to do this?” The biggest thing that’s probably difficult for people to think about is that it’s not going to be the same as your own pregnancies. So it’s worth thinking about how this pregnancy may affect your life. What if I need surgery for this? What if I develop preeclampsia and need to go on bed rest? What if I need to have a C-section. I would also ask yourself, ‘Are you a good communicator?’ I think good, clear communication between you and your physician, you and the biological parents is the number one most important thing to make it a successful process for everyone.“ NF: What has been one of your most memorable moments delivering a surro-baby?“I just had the greatest delivery over the summer. The European couple who had gone through lots of struggle made it here in time for the delivery, which was emotional. These moments are that much more satisfying when you know all the backstory and you’ve been through it with them. Everyone involved in the delivery was that much more invested because it was so hard with COVID for them to get over here. It was a married couple, two men, so clearly couldn’t conceive on their own, but they so wanted to have this baby. They were so excited and they cared so much for their surrogate. Every single person in the room was crying well before the baby was born. The dads were sobbing openly and hugging the surrogate mom and thanking her. It was just beautiful.” NF: If you think about surrogacy and you reflect on your practice, what is your big aha moment when it comes to surrogacy?“I think, especially during these times, all of us are more convinced than ever about the importance of family and close relationships. And there’s really no better gift than to be able to help someone or give someone the opportunity to have a child and build their family.” Have more questions? Learn how to become a surrogate.

    "content": "In the surrogacy world, women who become surrogates share a special and unique bond as #SurroSisters. Maggie and Jessica are not only Surrosisters, they are sisters in real life. After Jessica completed two successful surrogacy journeys for New York families, her sister Maggie was inspired to follow in her footsteps and become a surrogate. Jessica, a Pennsylvania resident, recently gave birth to her second surrobaby on the east coast and Maggie is currently matched with her intended parents from Illinois and embarking on her first surrogacy journey while living in Colorado. Nazca Fontes, founder of ConceiveAbilities and host of the All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast interviewed Jessica and Maggie to learn why they became surrogates, how they talked with their husbands and why matching with the right intended family is so important. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take from our real life surrogate sisters. NF: Jessica, what made you want to become a surrogate?“I thought about becoming a surrogate well before my first child was born. I got the idea to look into surrogacy probably based on TV shows like Friends when Phoebe was a surrogate. It was almost like it was produced in my head over the course of my adolescence. I set it on the back burner, but once I had my first child and realized how much I loved being pregnant, that’s when I pretty much said I was all in. I started doing more research on surrogacy to learn about the process of becoming a surrogate.” NF: Maggie, how did you feel about Jessica becoming a surrogate?“I was really curious about the impact on her emotionally and physically. I didn’t really have a whole lot of information to go off of, so I started asking her questions that you might not feel as comfortable asking a surrogate going through the process. But because Jessica is my sister, I didn’t really have any of those hesitations and I could just go ahead and ask them all.” NF: Jessica, how did you husband react when you told him you wanted to be a surrogate?“He didn’t really know what surrogacy meant and immediately questioned why. After some explanation of what surrogacy actually means today, he was much more open to the idea. Having an open and honest conversation about it definitely helped him understand the difference between what I call “old school surrogacy” and a modern surrogate mother. A gestational carrier is just a woman who carries a baby that’s not genetically related to them. They’re hosting someone else’s egg and sperm or donor egg and sperm. I am not genetically involved. A surrogate mother is just the oven, as most like to say in the surrogacy world.” NF: Maggie, what motivated you to become a surrogate?“I saw how amazing Jessica’s surrogacy journeys had been. And I had gotten a lot of really sweet questions from my friends who were having some challenges conceiving who knew that Jessica was a surrogate and had seen me during my pregnancies and had jokingly asked me to be their surrogate. I didn’t hesitate for a second in thinking absolutely I would, 100%. So if I would carry a baby for one of my friends, I thought why would I not carry a baby for someone that I just didn’t know yet? I also feel like there are these moments in life that I never really experienced before kids, when your heart skips a beat. The moment they are born, but also the small moments that make your heart just skip a beat and you get to watch someone’s heart, literally just melt right there. What an amazing experience to be in the presence of that and have something to do with it.” NF: Your sister was in Pennsylvania while you, Maggie, live outside of Denver, thousands of miles away. When did you know the time was right to follow in your sister’s surrogacy footprints?“I had really started thinking of it as an option for me after I had our second son. My work is pretty flexible as a therapist and I had a really great work life balance. I was in a really great emotional space. My relationship was supportive and safe and we weren’t planning on any travel. You can’t really be traveling all over the world when you’re a surrogate. While that is something that we love to do, our kids were so young. It felt like a really good time to be able to take a break and do something for someone else.” NF: Maggie, did your husband react differently to you becoming a surrogate mother?“We had first-hand experience because of Jessica so we had already really talked about it through her journey. You have to go into surrogacy with an open mind for sure, yet you also have expectations. I was just curious if those expectations were met for Jessica and if it was an overall incredible experience for her. So there weren’t a lot of concerns, only a lot of positives. So when we talked about it, he was really supportive.” NF: Jessica, how did you know the time was right?“When my son was four months old, I decided this is what I wanted to do. I knew for sure that I wanted to be a surrogate. That same day I jumped on my phone or a computer and started researching some agencies and that actually led me to ConceiveAbilities. I had experienced the pregnancy, I had experienced the delivery and I had experienced the birth and those first few months of having a baby. I was kind of back on that train of wanting to be pregnant again. I definitely was more on the surrogacy path than thinking about having another baby of my own. So timing plays a huge role in where you are in your own life versus where your plan for surrogacy lies.” NF: Maggie, how important was matching with your intended parent(s) in the process?“ConceiveAbilities did an amazing job in connecting us through Matching Matters. I honestly didn’t know if I would be connected to a family very quickly because we did have a lot of our own personal requirements. You go through a pretty lengthy process of what value system your family holds and matching those with a family that you’re going to be a surrogate for. When we got matched with our family who lives in Oak Park, we had an initial meeting and we hit it off really well. You can usually tell within the first few minutes, few seconds even, if you’re clicking and connecting, and I really did feel very connected to them. I felt like their midwestern values and ours really aligned. We have an excellent relationship where we’re able to communicate and we’re able to support each other. But we also have our own supports in place as well, so that if we’re struggling, we don’t necessarily need to lean on each other all the time. We’re different people, in different parts of the world coming together for this one goal and one purpose that we’re both really passionate about and I respect their grit and tenacity to have a family. That takes a lot of resilience to go through.” NF: Jessica, you have had the opportunity now to work with two families, both from New York, and have two distinct relationships built. How was your experience with your intended families?“They were both equally great, just very different and very positive. My first journey was with a single intended mom who had already had a baby. Our relationship was very laid back and easy, not overbearing or overwhelming. We had very similar personalities and we could be open with each other, and yet neither of us felt this urge to be overly communicative. She always made sure that I was comfortable and reminded me of how grateful and thankful she was. We still text on birthdays and holidays and she shares photos and updates about the baby I delivered. We have a very positive relationship to this day. After having such a great first experience, I didn’t know how I could top it. For my second journey, I wanted a couple who was having their first child so I could have the excitement of firsts with them and I wanted a couple so that the experience would include my husband. I wanted him to have somebody to connect with through the journey versus just kind of him being almost like the third wheel. When we first met them, it felt like we had been friends before we even went through the whole surrogacy process, like we had known each other prior to being connected through ConceiveAbilities. My husband definitely connected on a much different level than the first journey, because he could bond with the intended father and share this experience with another man becoming a father. They have a special relationship.” NF: Maggie, what would you tell other women considering becoming a surrogate?“I would tell other women looking to become a surrogate to make sure they understand their motivations and know there is a possibility that some expectations might not be met. Do you have the supports in place? Do you have the coping skills to be able to manage an intense emotional experience? If you’re able to answer all of those questions confidently, you will have an amazing experience. You’re going to learn something one way or another, and you’re going to have tremendous personal growth no matter what the outcome is.” NF: Jessica, can you describe the moment of delivering your surrobaby to the intended family?“If you ask any surrogate, their most exciting moment is going to be delivery day. Part of the motivation in being a surrogate is that pure gift of handing a baby over at the end, whether it’s a nine month journey or a two year journey. At the end of the day, to be able to see the look on your intended parents’ faces as they receive their new gift of life is life changing. The experience as a whole, just being able to witness the pure joy and contentment on your intended parents’ faces when they see their baby for the first time is pretty much indescribable.” If you are inspired by Jessica and Maggie’s surrogate mother story, apply now to see if you qualify to be a surrogate.",

    "content": "Andrea Syrtash is a nationally recognized relationship expert, author and founder of Pregnantish, an infertility and modern family building community she created after a painstaking ten-year journey through infertility that ultimately resulted in meeting her little girl, Aria, born through surrogacy. Nazca Fontes, founder of ConceiveAbilities and host of the All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast talked with Andrea about how infertility shaped her, how she navigated the long road to parenthood and why she was determined to build a community for others experiencing similar journeys to parenthood. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take on Andrea Syrtash’s perspective. NF: Your path to parenthood was complex. Why are you so passionate to share your story through your online community Pregnantish?“So many of us have been touched personally by the experience of modern family building, so it was easy to spark my passion because I saw how underserved this topic is. Infertility and modern family creation affects millions of people. Yet sometimes it’s this big dark secret for absolutely no reason, because it’s nobody’s fault if we need intervention to build our families. I was struggling over many years and I was feeling really isolated. I needed more content and resources that I couldn’t find, which led me to create Pregnantish four years ago.” NF: Agreed. We just founded Surrogacy Learning Center, an online community to help connect people who are interested in modern family building as well. One of the things you have said often that resonates with me is, “It’s the best club that you don’t want to be a member of.”“I think this painful experience has been one that nobody really wants to navigate on their own. When you have a medical issue or you need modern family building because of other reasons, maybe you’re in the LGBT world or you’re single, whatever the case may be, people’s well-meaning advice is not helpful. When you find a community who understands the pain point and the process, it’s life changing.” NF: When did you know you would have fertility challenges?“When I started menstruating around 14 years old, a doctor suspected I had endometriosis. I remember the doctor saying I may have fertility issues later, but I was 14 and the last thing I was thinking about was getting pregnant. When I married my husband, I told him that it may take us a year or two to conceive. I laugh at myself now, because it took us eight years, 18 fertility treatments, eight doctors, miscarriages, major surgery to remove a fibroid tumor and a lot of stops and starts and heartache before we finally met our daughter. In year six of trying to conceive with fertility treatments, we saw our reproductive endocrinologist who suspected my embryos were healthy and it was my uterus. After genetic testing, my doctor said I have good news and bad news. The good news is, I think you’re going to meet your baby because you have healthy embryos. The not as good news is, I don’t think you can carry your embryo and I’d like you to consider gestational surrogacy. I had never heard of that and I knew very little about surrogacy.” NF: Was your family history a big motivator for using your own embryo?“A lot of times people will ask you when you were doing gestational surrogacy, “Why do you need your own genetics?” We have so little family left on my father’s side, because they were killed in the Holocaust. Literally. I wanted to continue our bloodline, if it was possible. If I couldn’t, I would have been thrilled to bring a baby into the world and that baby would have been mine, no question. But it did have deeper meaning for me, in terms of literally rebuilding our family.” NF: How did you know surrogacy was right for you?“Through research (I had Google on my side), I realized surrogacy has really helped a lot of people build a family. It was a relief, because after six or seven years of fertility treatments, I was tired. I had taken thousands of shots in my belly and my backside and I was relieved to think about not trying again. The whole process of finding a gestational carrier was its own crazy chapter. We worked with an agency, not as good as yours. I won’t name it, but let’s just say the agency matters a lot. We had two surrogates drop out on us. When my last surrogate ghosted us, we had already paid, done all the legal and medical steps and the transfer was about to happen. I was devastated and couldn’t get out of bed. Then miraculously, my first cousin Alana texted and asked if I had ever thought of a family member carrying for me. I was shaking so much that I could barely respond. The rest is history.” NF: You are a relationship expert and you had a husband and a career. How did you balance everything while you were going through this emotional journey?“I wasn’t as together as I may have seemed to the outside world. When I came out on Facebook saying I was infertile, the last line of my post was don’t judge a Facebook by its cover because people had seen me on TV. I’d host television shows and go on book tours, but behind the scenes I was crying and struggling to keep it together.” NF: How did infertility affect your marriage?“I try to take my own advice as a relationship expert. I think the key to healthy relationships is being direct with respect and keeping communication open, which we tried to do. My husband and I were not always on the same page. There were times that he felt that he was done. There were times I felt I was done. I often tell couples after they receive sad news on this journey like, for instance, a failed IVF transfer, don’t decide your next step in that moment. You’re not thinking clearly. You need to literally take a moment, grieve, connect with each other, communicate, and then you’ll figure out where you’re at. I think we tried to make too many decisions in moments of stress and distress.” NF: What words of encouragement do you have for other hopeful parents building their family?“You have already shown you’re going to be a great parent by the dedication you’ve put into trying to become a parent. I mean, you’re doing this for someone you haven’t even met yet. I can only imagine the love, attention and dedication you will have once this being is here.” Read more about Andrea’s surrogacy journey in People. Have more questions?

    "content": "There’s much to celebrate in New York! After years of fighting to end the ban of compensated surrogacy and legal reform for the surrogacy process, the new law, effective February 15, 2021, makes dreams of a family a reality for New Yorkers! Not only is this great news for intended parents in New York, it’s also monumental for women who want to be gestational carriers to help these families. They can now become surrogates with some of the strongest protections available in the United States. Nazca Fontes, founder of ConceiveAbilities and host of the All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast talked with our partner, pioneering fertility expert Dr. James Grifo, director of NYU Langone Fertility Center, who shared his perspective on what the law means for New York, why it needed to change, and why he loves practicing in NYC. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take on Dr. Grifo’s perspective. NF: How did you become interested in specializing in fertility?“I’ve been practicing in the fertility field for about 35 years. When I did my rotation in obstetrics and gynecology as a medical student at Case Western Reserve, it became clear this was a field that was right for someone like me. My main goal was to use science to make IVF safer and better. Since then, we’ve developed a lot of new tools and techniques that have dramatically changed the way we practice, which is very relevant for the gestational carrier setting, because getting your gestational carrier pregnant with an embryo that either doesn’t make her pregnant or has a higher chance of making a miscarriage is a problem. We now have tools where we can select embryos, put back a single embryo, have a much lower miscarriage risk and have a much better chance of a good outcome. And that’s good for everybody.” NF: When it comes to surrogacy in New York, what makes New Yorkers great partners in their surrogacy journey?“The best part about practicing in New York is the patients. New York patients are very educated and very savvy. They’re just amazing. They’re diverse: they are single men and women, lesbian couples, gay dads, and heterosexual couples. We help people build families and it’s great because loved and wanted children are the secret sauce to a better world.” NF: Why did the New York laws lag so far behind the rest of the country?“The original case that led to the New York law was Mary Beth Whitehead. She carried a pregnancy, which came from her egg. She was inseminated with the husband of the couple that was going to get the baby. In the midst of pregnancy, she changed her mind and it became this awful litigation. I think the litigators at the time, not knowing where the future was going, passed a very restrictive law that basically criminalized helping a patient have a family through a gestational carrier. What they didn’t anticipate in the law was that there would come a day where we could take eggs and embryos and make embryos from a couple or an individual and put genetic material in a gestational carrier that would not have any genetic relationship to her. So that’s where the term gestational carrier is a more precise term because it implies that this embryo has nothing to do with the carrier. She’s basically carrying a pregnancy for someone else, not related to her, so they can have a baby they otherwise wouldn’t be able to. The legislation that was passed back then prevented us from helping that couple or the woman who didn’t have a uterus because she had a hysterectomy but had embryos or the woman who was born without a uterus or the gay couple where there is no uterus. It basically cut them out of building families and what wasn’t the intent of the law. It’s a tragedy that it took this long, but thankfully it’s happening.” NF: Before the law passed, what did it mean for New Yorkers seeking surrogacy to build their families?“We had a patient in New York who couldn’t carry her own child. Her sister-in-law volunteered to be an altruistic carrier but we were terrified because we were subject to being criminals. Doing the transfer in New York at the time, as a doctor, you put your whole career on your line trying to help a patient. We know what our intent is. To think that someone out there wanted to put us in jail for that really is not a good feeling when you know what you’re doing is absolutely right. Mainly what we did was we would make embryos here. We would ship embryos to the place where the carrier would be in another state and where the laws were more friendly, like New Jersey, Connecticut, or California. It added an excessive expense and burden to the patient. It also meant they could not be local with their carrier. Then you have a law that makes it even more costly for no good reason – that’s really adding insult to injury. Thankfully now it will be okay.” NF: How will the new law impact the lives of New Yorkers going through surrogacy journeys?“It allows them to do it here in New York. They don’t have to travel and add extra cost, burden and complexity to an already complex process. It respects them as people who want to have children and they should get that respect and family building opportunity. It’s a big breakthrough for our New York patients and also for women in New York who want to be a gestational carrier because that is an amazing job that someone does. They feel like they have made a huge difference in the world by giving that gift to a couple or an individual who wants to raise a child who couldn’t otherwise carry that child. The ability to give that gift is very special.” NF: In your experience, what motivates a woman to be a gestational carrier?“They know what a gift and a privilege it is to have a child and they can only imagine what it’s like for somebody who can’t have that gift. They take their job of giving that family a gift incredibly seriously. If you’re someone who’s using a gestational carrier and you’re smart about how you manage your care, you have to treat them like they are doing the most important job in the world for you. When that happens, it’s always a win-win situation. The carrier feels great about what she’s done and the family who gets a baby, who would not have had a baby, understands what a gift and a privilege that is.” NF: What has been the biggest aha moment in the surrogacy field throughout your career?“I think the most critical aha moment for this field is single embryo transfer, which leads to such better outcomes.” NF: How is NYU Langone Fertility Center ready to serve New Yorkers choosing surrogacy?“We’re looking at the way other surrogacy professionals have worked with gestational carriers in America and trying to take the best of everything and build our process. We know the embryo side of it, that’s what we’ve been doing for years. Now, we will actually be managing the carriers, helping them get pregnant, and making sure they get optimal care. We have to do everything we can to assure that this gestational carrier will have a safe, good outcome. There’s a whole team involved in making this process happen. Working with the agencies is fun because we know we can help a whole new group of patients be a part of the surrogacy process.” Have more questions?

    "content": "As New York celebrates a new dawn, with legalization of compensated surrogacy on Monday, February 15th, read on to hear from a New York mother, Cynara, and from a gestational carrier, Sara, about what it’s been like to complete a surrogacy journey to-date. Two side with one mission. Joyful, still, but better days are ahead for hopeful parents and surrogates in New York. Cynara’s story When I imagined becoming a parent, one of the recurrent fantasies involved lovingly rubbing a growing belly and feeling the tiny life my husband and I created growing and somersaulting inside. I recall having these pleasant daydreams that only increased in frequency once we found out we were pregnant for the first time. I couldn’t wait to bond with my baby and feel that sense of connection that would only grow in size as the weeks and months passed. But, unfortunately, that was not my journey to parenthood. After several miscarriages over 10 years, my husband and I threw what we considered our “Hail Mary” pass – we decided to look into working with a gestational carrier (surrogate). Aside from the financial worries and the anxiety of not knowing whether it would work was the discovery that compensated surrogacy was not legal in New York. My husband and I were shocked and somewhat despondent. I felt betrayed by the state that I always considered to be the bastion of inclusion and progressive ideals. How could Georgia, my home state, have more progressive family planning laws than New York?! In learning of that obstacle, I had yet another hurdle to feeling connected to the life we wanted to bring into the world. Not only was I not going to be able to carry my own child, a loss in and of itself, but now I would not be able to feel connected to the pregnancy at all. Sara, the amazing person we matched with, lives in Ohio. That’s hours away from our home in Brooklyn, New York. That decision meant that I would miss doctor’s visits, the ability to feel Sara’s tummy as our baby grew, or even talk to our baby in utero. And the scariest and most worrisome concern that clouded the experience was whether we would even have the ability to make it to the hospital in time for our baby’s birth. Not only did multiple flights to and from Ohio for us and for Sarah and her husband mean added financial burden, it created more complexity and uncertainty to an already uncertain situation. What we also didn’t consider was what would happen once our baby was born and what else we would miss out on as a result. Bringing a child into the world is a very intimate endeavor and while everyone’s expectations and needs may differ, we fell in love with the Vecchi family. Sara, Matt and their boys became as important to us as our own families. If we lived in the same state, I know that the Vecchi family would have been present at every birthday party and special milestone. I want that possibility for other New York parents. I want them to have the ability to rub the belly of the person that is carrying their child. I want them to be able to easily take off a few hours to attend a doctor’s appointment. I want them to have greater certainty that they won’t miss the birth of the child they’ve so desperately wanted. That’s an experience you can’t get back and one you will never forget. And, I want New York families through surrogacy to have the opportunity to enjoy a lifetime of connection to the women and their families that gave them the most remarkable gift ever – the gift of parenthood. That’s why it was so important to me to fight for this legal right. I cried tears of joy when the law was passed, because I knew what a difference it would make to families like ours. Sara’s story My surrogate journey with the Charles-Pierre family has been hands-down one of my favorite things I have done in my life. Matching with someone to embark on this life-changing journey with you is a big deal, especially with people I had met only once face-to-face. After a couple of long phone calls, Cynara and her husband offered to fly out to meet us before we all began our partnership in earnest. We were so glad to have that opportunity, but it would have been wonderful to have the chance to interact in-person several times before making such an important decision. Matching with someone within your own state would likely make that opportunity much more feasible. Once you have gotten past the anxiety and excitement of finding a good match, you prepare for the transfer. I can actually speak from experience when I say that a transfer in your home state takes much less coordination. I certainly didn’t mind the flights we took or the stays we had out of state for both our medical evaluations and for the transfer itself, but it meant a greater expense for intended parents to cover and more organization on our end to take care of responsibilities at home while we were gone. An in-state transfer took about the same time as a workday, and I was back home to pick up my sons from the babysitter that same evening. After learning the transfer was successful, we began the longest part of our journey: nine months of slowly growing a baby. This is where I feel we missed the most. We kept in contact via text and occasional phone calls, and they came out to attend a couple doctor appointments and tour the hospital where we were to deliver. It would have been wonderful to be able to have Cynara there for more of the appointments, and these visits would have provided us more time to establish a deeper relationship. When it comes to the highlight of the whole experience, the birth, you want to be very comfortable with your intended parents. This kind of closeness came naturally in our experience, but I could easily see this being something that would only come from spending more time together, especially for those who may be more introverted in nature. The biggest challenge we faced with the delivery was getting the intended parents here in time! Natural labor happened a week earlier than expected, so I had to quickly call and give them a heads up that I was heading to the hospital. From that moment, they had to get their things, get to an airport, get a flight, fly, and then travel to the hospital from the airport. We were lucky that my labor slowed after they arrived, but there were so many variables that could have led to them missing the actual birth. I was so relieved to hear when they touched down in Ohio. One of the things that hangs over me now is how distance keeps us apart. I recognize that not every surrogate or couple may desire to remain in close contact, but I know that we are also not alone in wanting to be involved! If we were closer, we could be there for birthday parties, dance recitals, sports competitions, or whatever else the future may hold. The legalization of surrogacy in New York has opened the door for these kinds of bonds to be formed between countless families in the future. Women like me who have a desire to help families who would not otherwise have their own children will now have that opportunity. Parents like Cynara will now have the option to partner with someone closer to home and be able to extend this close and special relationship past the delivery of the baby if they so choose. This legalization allows, and maybe even encourages, the relationships which I feel make the surrogacy experience so special. Have more questions?

    "content": "Matching with your surrogate is one of the most exciting parts of your surrogacy journey. Choosing the perfect match for you and your family can also raise many questions, however, which is why we wanted to chat some more with mom-to-be, Ashley. Ashley and her husband are expecting their first baby with the help of their long-distance surrogate this spring. While matching with a long-distance surrogate can come with unique challenges, it also has its perks! Here’s a few of the reasons their long-distance surrogate was a match, and why Ashley wouldn’t have it any other way: What were your expectations when being matched with a surrogate and what have you learned since your match was made? When my husband and I started the surrogacy process, we were not really sure what expectations we should have as it was very new to us. All we knew for certain was that we wanted to find a surrogate who was totally open, honest and willing to be flexible and understanding. We also both felt it was very important for our surrogate to come from a nurturing home with a supportive and loving family. When we started working with ConceiveAbilities, we were told that matching with someone is like dating and when you know you know. That is exactly how it happened when we matched with our surrogate! The moment we hung up the phone, we knew what our expectations were and that she was everything we had hoped for. We learned that this whole experience is not only about our needs because it is our baby, but it is also about the gestational carrier’s needs which are just as important. What has made your relationship with your surrogate work so well? We got to know each other’s personalities fairly quickly, including how we each prefer to communicate and how often. We both work full time and have a mutual respect for each other’s schedule, however, we always make time to discuss pertinent information and check in as often as possible. I believe that the little bit of separation we have between Florida and Minnesota has, in fact, brought us closer together. Because of the distance, any time we catch up on FaceTime or over the phone, we try to truly live in the moment and appreciate the conversation that much more! Did you have reservations about matching with a surrogate from another state? After we matched with our surrogate, I did have some reservations. I thought there would be no way we would be able to make this whole thing work while being so many miles apart. I very quickly learned, however, that distance literally plays no part in the grand scheme of things. Traveling to Minnesota has actually been a fun and exciting part of our journey! My husband and I had never visited the state before and we have been fully embracing the time we get to share in a new place with our superstar surrogate and her wonderful family. Can you give any pros and cons of working with a long distance surrogate? The pros of being long-distance is that it forces you to be less controlling. I know that if our surrogate was local, I would feel the need to “check-in” often. With our situation, I don’t have the ability to do so and, honestly, it’s a blessing. I have also found that we cherish our relationship with our surrogate more, since our visits are limited. When we do see each other, we fully embrace the moment. For me, the biggest con is feeling a little bit more disconnected to the actual pregnancy. Often, I wish I could see our surrogate more just so that we could experience the growth of her blossoming belly bump and have the opportunity to talk and sing to our baby boy while in utero. Another con is having to be okay with a birth plan that could change. It is logistically challenging to plan when you live in different states, even with a scheduled c-section. You have to have a backup plan and be on standby for the big day! How have you maintained a long distance relationship with your surrogate? My husband and I have maintained an amazing relationship with our surrogate and mostly because we are on the same page. We know when we need to communicate and what about. We are both very understanding of each other’s expectations and respect the time, or lack thereof, that we have in our busy days. What advice would you have for people who are worried about a long distance match? There will always be pros and cons for being either long distance or nearby. Remember that. The priority should always be to just match with someone you feel truly connected to. As we have learned, the rest will fall into place.

    "content": "The use of gestational carriers for families wanting children is on the rise. That’s why ConceiveAbilities continues to support the family building process by taking further steps to expand our legal team. It’s hard to imagine that surrogacy only went mainstream in the mid-eighties and now the global surrogacy market is expected to reach $27.5 billion through 2025, according to estimates from Global Market Insights. According to the “Assisted Reproductive Technology Fertility Clinic Success Rates Report 2018” released in December 2020 by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion’s Division of Reproductive Health (CDC), surrogacy accounts for 4.7% of all embryo transfers (IVF), up from 4.2% just one year prior. And a survey done by the Family Equality Council estimates that 63% of LGBTQ people planning families will consider assisted reproductive technologies (ART) to become parents. To meet this increasing need for expanding families with the use of gestational carriers and egg donors, ConceiveAbilities continues to strengthen an already extensive legal program. Under the leadership of Director of Legal Services, Gina-Marie Madow, Esq., we work closely with Melissa Torto, Esq. and, as a combined force, Madow and Torto bring over two decades of assisted reproductive technologies (“ART”) law experience to provide legal oversight of the entire surrogacy process, from start to finish. Expanded legal services include: Providing intended parents with legal education and oversight throughout the surrogacy and/or egg donation process Establishing direct representation of intended parents for their contracts with gestational carriers and egg donors, to ensure matches are legally sound Assisting and overseeing intended parents’ establishment of their parental rights Working with local counsel in other states and countries for specific legal support as necessary as well as to staying current with ever-evolving laws Gina-Marie Madow has spent her entire career assisting thousands of parents with all aspects of their surrogacy and egg donation journeys.

    "content": "At 37, Joseph Tito was a jet-setting successful film and TV director and producer, living his dream. One early morning, he awoke in his Dubai hotel and realized he wanted more out of life. He wanted a family. He documents his fatherhood journey on his blog The Dad Diaries that chronicled his surrogacy journey as a gay single dad and, now, his parenting adventures raising twin girls. Nazca Fontes, CEO and founder of ConceiveAbilities, had an intimate chat with Joseph on our new show All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast about his journey to become a father through surrogacy, the hurdles he navigated as a single gay man and why he felt so strongly to share his story with other men like him dreaming of starting their own families. Listen to the full episode here. And, read on for a quick take on Joseph’s raw and authentic perspective. NF: How has the decision to become a dad and now raising two daughters changed your life?“How hasn’t it changed my life? I always said to myself that by the time I’m 35, I wanted to be a dad. I didn’t know how, what, where, when any of that, but I kept saying that to myself and then 35 came and went. I was executive producing and directing all over the world and traveling and so that window just passed. When I turned 37, I thought that I don’t want to be a 60 year old with a toddler. I looked into all my options and, as a gay single man at the time, there were really not that many options. Adoption was extremely difficult. So, I looked into surrogacy and that’s kind of how my journey began.” NF: What was the one moment in time that sparked your action to become a father?“I was lying in bed in a seven star hotel in Dubai. I was very fortunate. I was making great money and I had everything I wanted and could travel anywhere. But it just seemed empty and lonely. You work your whole life to try to be successful and try doing what you love. And then when you do it, you start feeling like there has to be more to life than your career. That’s when I realized, it was now or never. At the time I did have a partner, so I called him and said, “I want kids. We’ve been together for four years and we’re not getting any younger. And so let’s start this.” NF: And was your partner on board?“With his words? Yes, but not with his actions. As a gay man, you have disposable income, you can pick up and go whenever you please. So, to change that lifestyle to that of a traditional family was a very difficult decision for him. He went along with it initially. I documented the whole journey through video. I went through five embryo transfers; it was a long, painful journey. As I was editing all my stuff, I realized that I was doing it by myself and he wasn’t into it like I was.” NF: So during your journey, this partnership became an individual journey as a single man?“There was never really any partnership in the journey. Financially, it was all me and when it was time to go to Kenya to meet my surrogate, he declined because he was busy with work. After that and many other signs I said to him, “Listen, I don’t think this is something you really want. Maybe we should break up and maybe I’ll find someone who wants the same thing.” In my head I thought he would profess his love for me and realize he wanted to be a family. But he didn’t and our relationship ended. So, I was dealing with a third failed embryo transfer, which really gets to you, and dealing with that breakup as well.” NF: You wrote in your blog on The Dad Diaries that a lot of gay men didn’t understand your desire to become a father. Why do you feel that?“My friends still don’t get it. They have asked why I would change my lifestyle especially since having a kid is a lot of work. You have to put yourself aside and for a long time and live for someone else: your children. Since I didn’t have the traditional pressures to have a family, they have had a hard time understanding why I would want that.” NF: How important has support been as a single parent going through a surrogacy journey?“My parents were my biggest supporters and absolutely amazing. I first spoke to my mom about adoption and then surrogacy, she was beyond excited. I was kind of keeping it quiet from my dad. Then one day I called and he came on the phone and he was just so excited about the whole thing. I felt very supported. I went through five embryo transfers. After the fourth failed embryo transfer, I felt like maybe this wasn’t what I should be doing in my life. Maybe God doesn’t want me to be a dad. I had a lot of people also on social media that were against a gay man going through surrogacy. All those things started taking a toll. Without my parents, honestly I don’t know where I would be. Throughout the surrogacy journey and after the girls were born, my parents have been and are my greatest support.” NF: Did your parents have reservations about you as a gay single man going through surrogacy?“My mom was always amazing with me when I told her I was gay. My dad came around. I think for them, the biggest fear was that I would be alone and I would have nobody to share my life with and to support me. I think the decision to start a family put those fears away for them and that’s why they were so supportive. They were also excited that I chose surrogacy and that my genes were passed down, but mostly they were happy I was creating a family, because family is so important to them.” NF: The Dad Diaries earned an award as a top YouTube channel for single dads. Why is it so important for you to be a voice in your community?“I started The Dad Diaries because I’m in film and television and I was going to document my journey into fatherhood regardless. And also when my girls hate me as teenagers, I want to show them what I went through to have them. Joking aside, there wasn’t a lot out there for me when I began my surrogacy journey. There were a lot of countries where surrogacy as a gay man or gay couple is just not even allowed. I found a lot of research on women who are infertile who choose the surrogacy route. Even in Canada, the first IVF treatment is free, so there’s a lot of resources for women. I found that as a gay man and as a single man, I didn’t really have that. I couldn’t find resources and information that helped me navigate all of the questions and fears I had about the surrogacy process. Since then, I’ve learned about more surrogacy agencies that will help you from A to Z that I didn’t even know existed. And, there is professional help out there for sure that can help guide you through the surrogacy process and I want to share what I’ve learned. Building the community has been amazing. I get numerous amounts of emails daily from single men and gay men asking questions. They just want someone to listen to them and they just want someone to tell them that it’s going to be okay and that it will work out. For me to be able to be that person for someone else makes it worthwhile for me.” NF: If you could change anything about your surrogacy, what would it be?“I wouldn’t change anything because I have my girls, but that aside, I would definitely change the agency I picked. It’s all about your agency. They will make it easier or harder on you. The agency I chose felt very much like a business that was only concerned with the money. It lacked human connection and didn’t seem to be concerned with my individual experience or acknowledge that each journey is unique. Each one is a person and not just a client, especially when you’re talking about babies and someone’s dream. I just found it very cold. My advice to anyone thinking about surrogacy is to carefully choose the best surrogacy agency for you – one that has a good reputation for its support and service throughout the process.” NF: What lessons have you learned that could help other single men embarking on a surrogacy journey?“It takes a village for sure. Get all the help you can. I’m the type of person that tends to try to do everything by myself. If you’re going through surrogacy, and I know it’s easier said than done, you have to let it go, trust the process and ask and accept all the support you can get.” NF: I love your Instagram. How has becoming a father changed your life?“My life revolves around my family now. It’s more inclusive. My friends are different now. My best friends that I had before disappeared because they just don’t get it. My family has changed. I have a partner now. I spend more time with my extended family. I used to direct a TV show for 18 hours a day on set for a month at a time and not miss a beat. Now I’m just always exhausted. I never seem to get enough sleep and I wouldn’t trade it for the world. The other night, the girls slept at my mom’s and we wanted to take one night to sleep and just wake up when we wanted. And I woke up still at the same time, because after two years your body is up and I just had this feeling that I missed them so much. It was crazy how much I actually missed them and it was literally one day that I didn’t see them. People asked me if I would change being a dad? Maybe my life would be easier, but I couldn’t imagine my life without them.” ConceiveAbilities is proud to be a gay friendly surrogacy agency. We believe anyone who wants to be a parent should have the same opportunity to fulfill their family destiny, including gay dads. It’s our privilege to serve both single parents and same sex couples.

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has taken us all on a rollercoaster ride of emotions over the past year. While the experience has left many people feeling uncertain, Ashley Katzen and her husband decided to move forward with their surrogacy journey and are making their dream of becoming parents a reality, in spite of the global pandemic. We spoke to Ashley about her decision, how COVID has impacted their pregnancy, and why she believes other couples should not press pause on their own dreams of a family. Here’s what Ashley had to say: What made you decide to move forward with your surrogacy journey during a pandemic? I had spent all of three minutes thinking about whether or not I would postpone my goals and lifelong dream of becoming a mother because of the pandemic. In those three minutes, I thought: “This will be hard, it will be challenging logistically to travel, and it will put all of us at risk and potentially compromise our health.” Then, I thought about how this entire process is a challenge. Nothing is easy. My husband and I came up with alternatives for how we could be “present” during the process from a distance and we decided to take the risk of moving forward. At the time, there was a ban on elective procedures that was expected to be lifted right before our planned transfer day, and we were not willing to miss out on this small window of opportunity before something could potentially happen again. Luckily, our superstar surrogate was totally on board with us! How has COVID affected traveling during your surrogacy journey? Were you able to meet your surrogate in person to, for instance, do your transfer in person? How have you been handling pregnancy milestones? With the timing of our pregnancy, our travel schedule was minimally affected by the pandemic. We always planned to be present for the 20-week anatomy scan, which we fortunately were able to attend. We traveled with all of our PPE and tried to minimize our risk of exposure as much as possible. It would have been nice to be at the 12-week appointment, but we knew there would have to be some compromises on what we could and could not do, especially since this pregnancy was happening during the pandemic, and in another state. I feel that even without COVID, it is really hard to feel truly connected to the pregnancy milestones when you are not the one who is pregnant. I felt like I couldn’t “nest” because I am missing the physical part of carrying the baby. We are approaching 30 weeks in a few days, which is a huge milestone – and still, it is a distant feeling of excitement when you are not able to do it on your own. I must admit, this part of the journey has been a constant challenge for me. How has your birth plan changed because of COVID? Before the pandemic hit, we had a scheduled c-section planned. When we discussed the details with our surrogate’s health care provider, she let us know that during a c-section, only one person is allowed in the room. However, we were also informed that for special circumstances there is SOME flexibility and sometimes both intended parents are allowed to be present in the room for the birth. Now with COVID, those special circumstances are unfortunately few and far between. My husband and I both feel the desire to share this experience together, with our surrogate, since this is the one milestone we can actually participate in together. Not knowing if he will be able to be in the delivery room with us makes my husband and I feel like we are being stripped of our rights as parents. For us to not witness the most important moment of our lives together would be devastating. What are you most anxious or nervous about? I am most fearful that my husband and I will not have the opportunity to share the special moment and beautiful experience of our first child being born. At this point in time, my surrogate has chosen me to be the one person that she has in the room with her and we hope that on the day of the c-section they will allow for us to both be present. We surely will not give up without a fight! What advice do you have for other families considering surrogacy during COVID? While there are many ups and downs and compromises to be made, don’t push off your dreams of becoming a parent because of the pandemic… Nothing in life worth working for is easy, and in the end, the risk is very much worth the reward!

    "content": "Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra announced they welcomed their first baby, a girl, via a surrogate according to People Magazine. Both proud new parents posted this sweet message on their Instagram pages: “We are overjoyed to confirm that we have welcomed a baby via surrogate. We respectfully ask for privacy during this special time as we focus on our family. Thank you so much.” For 25 years we have experienced first-hand how surrogacy fulfills dreams and we are overjoyed for the happy family! Congratulations! What is Surrogacy? Many of you may be asking what is surrogacy and how did that help Nick and Priyanka grow their family. Surrogacy is a modern and growing means of bringing new life into the world, where a woman carries a baby for another person or a couple. The intended parents undergo IVF meaning fertilization outside of the body, to transfer their embryo into the surrogate’s uterus. A surrogate, or gestational carrier, is a woman who carries a baby for an individual or a couple that has no genetic relationship to her. Our job as a surrogacy agency is to help find and match a surrogate and intended family who have shared values and expectations. More and more families like Nick and Priyanka are turning to surrogacy as a successful option to help build their family. Many celebrities from Kim Kardashian to Neil Patrick Harris have chosen to partner with a surrogate to make their family dreams come true. And it’s not just celebrities. In 2019, surrogates were part of 5.4% of all in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. Why? It is the most successful treatment for infertility, with a 75% success rate. That number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. Watch fertility expert Dr. Robby Setton of Shady Grove Fertility in New York talk about how surrogacy has been normalized. Who Needs A Surrogate? As a surrogate, you can give the gift of family to people who otherwise couldn’t have a child of their own. Dr. Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron from Fertility Centers of Illinois shared reasons why people may need a surrogate. Reasons to use a surrogate range from individuals who are struggling with infertility or with medical history such as a hysterectomy or cancer, or members of the gay community. Whether you are an intended parent looking to find the right surrogate for you or a woman thinking about becoming a surrogate to help people fulfill their dream of parenthood, the first step is learning more about the process to become a surrogate. We have compiled important facts about surrogacy in our blog Everything You Need To Know About Surrogacy. The emotional appeal, though, is the real growth story of this modern approach to building families. Anderson Cooper delivered a beautiful tribute to the power of surrogacy that you can find here.

    "content": "Surrogacy From A Surrogate Husband’s Point of View Becoming a surrogate is a personal decision and one that changes the lives of both the intended family and her own family. At ConceiveAbilities, our research shows that the number one influencer for a surrogate embarking on a surrogacy journey is her partner. Having a supporting husband or partner throughout a surrogacy journey is essential. Understandably, your significant other might have apprehensions about their wife wanting to become a surrogate. So, how do you start the conversation? Jonathan Compton and his wife Laci had been married for a few years when she first expressed interest in becoming a surrogate. Jonathan, an active duty US Airforce airman in Alaska, candidly shares how he and Laci decided surrogacy was the right path for their family and how it changed their life. What was your family situation when Laci told you she wanted to be a surrogate? “We had had our first child Lila when Laci expressed an interest in being a surrogate. We had been married two or three years. We took a pause on surrogacy, though, due to deciding to have another child of our own. We picked things back up a few years later when both our children were a little bit older. Because it was something we had discussed early in our marriage and the time was right for our family, it wasn’t a surprise when she reached out to ConceiveAbilities to begin her surrogacy journey.” Are there any misconceptions or fears about the surrogacy process you needed to gain knowledge about to feel comfortable with Laci starting the process? “I honestly did not understand how the surrogate process worked early on. I knew the child would not be ours genetically. So I became very familiar with the entire IVF process. Giving shots was a small hurdle but nothing big. Laci was better about it than I was. I think a second part of this question is that I was initially hesitant in telling our families what we were doing, because going through pregnancy for another couple rather than bringing another child to the family seemed controversial. Most of the family was very supportive in this journey and, those that had questions about it, mainly did not know what it was. Once we informed them the child would not have our genetic material, they were relieved and became accepting of the idea.” From your perspective, how was the surrogacy pregnancy different from Laci’s other pregnancies? “Surrogacy pregnancy was special because Laci was able to carry and deliver a baby for another family. I know that is very basic. Throughout the pregnancy, our intended parents’ encouragement and excitement was very uplifting and gave reason and purpose to why we were doing this.” Were you anxious about the delivery? What was your role in the delivery process? “We were given the opportunity to deliver in a very nice labor and delivery center. I admire Laci’s passion for birth and delivery, and have been able to take part in her three deliveries alongside nursing and midwifery staff. We did prep work for the delivery so, as a husband and partner to Laci, I could help keep the course of our birth plan and hopefully brought a little comfort along the way.” Does your family have a relationship with the surro-babe family? “At the time of pregnancy and delivery, we were lucky to live not too far away from the intended parents, in relative terms for the surro-world. Our families have gotten together multiple times as friends as they were only a few hours drive away. We have moved since due to career changes, but we stay in close contact and get many pictures of the chubby cheeked little baby boy that Laci helped to bring into the world.” What are the top things you would tell someone who is unsure about his/her partner becoming a surrogate? “Communication is really going to be huge through the whole journey, starting in the beginning all the way to the end. Explore the parts of the surrogacy that make you unsure. It is a different path than most people take so it is going to beg questions. I really appreciated the interactions with ConceiveAbilities’ staff members. They had a lot of experience with many couples and surrogate journeys. They always encouraged us to do what was best and right in our minds when it came to the whole process. One thing that helped me early on was remembering Laci had a yearning to help another family to become as complete as we are in our own lives. Knowing that she had a desire to help others was always the root of why she decided to be a surrogate, and I did not want to stop her pursuit.” How did your wife becoming a surrogate change your life? “Not only was it magical for Laci, it was a huge life changing event for myself and our family. Our daughters are so proud that their mom was a surrogate who gave the greatest gift you can give. I am excited to help other partners navigate surrogacy and share what I learned on the Surrogacy Learning Center.” Have more questions? Please do contact us to talk more.

    "content": "By now, we’re all aware that COVID-19 vaccines are being actively administered to priority groups throughout the United States. While this is hopefully great news to curb the effects of the pandemic, there are a variety of views about vaccination. Should I Get Vaccinated if I am Pregnant or Going To Be Pregnant? If you’re a surrogate, will the COVID-19 vaccine be safe for you and the baby you are or will be carrying? If you are an intended parent, do you want the surrogate you are working with to be vaccinated, or not be vaccinated? What if the relationship between surrogates and intended parents is strained by these uncertainties and differences of view? How will new variations of the coronavirus be impacted by these vaccines? If you want a vaccination, are you eligible and when can you receive it? Should you receive two doses, one dose or a partial dose? To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate There are no easy answers to the questions surfacing around COVID-19 vaccines, and it’s okay if your opinion differs from someone else’s. Following the steps below, though, may help surrogates and intended parents alike find ways to collaborate effectively in this very important decision-making process. Have a Conversation First, we always encourage honest and respectful dialogue between intended parents and surrogates. Ideally, a conversation will help you to understand each others’ perspectives better and perhaps allow you to come to an agreement. If you need help figuring out how to broach this topic or share your thoughts, reach out to your match manager for guidance. Talk to Your Doctor Keep in mind that this is a medical issue. While there may be unknowns associated with the COVID vaccines, some studies show there may be heightened risks for pregnant women who contract COVID. As a result, it’s very important to talk to your fertility doctor or OB as you gather information about this decision. Hearing your doctor’s best recommendation may be all that you need to feel much more clear and comfortable about the best course of action. Review the Recommendations While there is limited data about these vaccines in the context of pregnancy, there are thoughtful statements that are publicly available from some of the leading experts in the field. Click on the links below to see the most recent statements from the following organizations: American Society of Reproductive Medicine The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists The Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine’s statement of December 1, 2020 Here’s one great decision aid that brings it all together, brought to you by the experts at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Validate your Options Finally, since vaccinations are being managed by state and local health authorities, there is tremendous variation in both the availability and process to receiving a vaccination. Do your research online and with the medical professionals that are supporting your journey to find out what vaccines are available near you and what steps you would need to take to receive one. If you do decide to move forward with vaccination and meet the eligibility criteria, please follow all instructions diligently, including dosage amounts and timing. And continue to diligently practice safe public health practices, including mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing and all local and CDC guidance. While vaccinations can be a complex and thorny issue, especially during these unprecedented days of the coronavirus pandemic, we encourage intended parents and surrogates to have open dialogue, seek the best advice of medical professionals, including your doctor, and validate your options.

    "content": "2020 has been a year full of ups and downs for most of us. As this hectic year comes to a close, follow along in Ashley’s journey, as she navigates towards the birth of her first baby. Ashley and her husband are expecting their son this spring, with a little help from their long-distance surrogate! Join us as we discuss the topics you want to talk about; deciding on surrogacy during a pandemic, what it is like to have a long distance surrogate, and how to talk about your infertility struggles with your family and friends during the holidays… And, perhaps most importantly, learning to be there for yourself through life’s hard moments. But before we dive in, let’s get to know Ashley, our mom-to-be! Tell us about yourself! My name is Ashley Katzen and I am 33 years old. I live in Miami Beach, FL with my husband of 2 years. I own a Talent Acquisition agency that specializes in hiring, staffing, and recruiting in the fashion industry. In my free time, I focus on giving back to the pancreatic cancer community, as I tragically lost my mother to this disease 9 years ago. Both my husband and I love to travel and explore the world! We are absolutely in love with where we live and look forward to building our family here. Can you describe your infertility struggle? When did you first find out you would be unable to carry? At 16 years old I was diagnosed with vaginal agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. My mother was concerned that I had not gotten my period, so we went to the OB for a checkup. To everyone’s surprise, our doctor noticed that there was an absence of my vaginal canal. We then proceeded with an ultrasound and learned that I did have my eggs, but that my uterus and cervix were missing, as well. During that time, I had to make a very difficult decision with my mother on whether or not I was going to surgically create a vaginal canal, or choose dilator treatment, which is done independently. I followed my doctor’s recommendation and spent over a year independently using dilators. The main disadvantage is that it required using a dilator 3 times a day (different sizes as I progressed through my journey) for 20 minutes at a time (on a bicycle seat) until eventually, the vaginal canal was stretched to a normal length. I really did not know pain and discomfort until that experience. I also did not understand the magnitude of how difficult it would be – both emotionally and physically – when it came time to have kids. I do, however, remember thinking that nothing would have been worse than that experience. As I got older and had boyfriends, I had to explain my situation with not being able to get pregnant, and many of them were not too accepting. News also started to get around about my situation in high school, and people doubted my gender and whether or not I was born a female. The struggle was unimaginable at such a young age, but it truly prepared me for IVF and my surrogacy journey. How did you decide to choose surrogacy… What did you try before, and why was surrogacy the right decision for you? Knowing that I had viable eggs, it was never not an option for me to have children that were genetically mine. At one point in time I explored the idea of having a uterus transplant, but the success rate was low with a lot of still born babies and, therefore, I always knew that surrogacy was the route I would go. How did you decide on a surrogacy agency? I did a lot of research. I called and interviewed many agencies in advance of choosing ConceiveAbilities. There were many factors that weighed in on the decision-making process, for example: fees, support teams, reputation, knowledge, attitude, and organization. After getting to know the team at ConceiveAbilities, and their level of organization, efficiency, attention to detail and structure, I knew that it was the right agency for us. What have you learned about yourself throughout this journey? I thought that the most difficult part of this journey for me would be IVF, but I learned VERY quickly that not carrying my own child (while there are many benefits) is by far the hardest part… You feel totally out of control, guilty, separated, disconnected, and negligent. Sometimes, it doesn’t even feel like it’s happening. However, though this journey I learned that it is OK to give up control. I learned to be more patient and understanding. My superstar surrogate taught me how to trust her by really including me every step of the way. Most importantly, I learned that I simply could not expect people to understand what I was going through, especially if they hadn’t gone through it. I became extremely sad and frustrated any time I had expectations of the way I wanted to receive support from people. I eventually learned how to be there for myself. I never thought I could do that. But I can, and I am. Join our Surrogacy Learning Center to continue the conversation – CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP TODAY!

    "content": "COVID has impacted every facet of our lives, including medical care. As you embark on your surrogacy journey during this unprecedented time, COVID-19 brings new challenges. And still for many people, it has inspired more determination than ever to find a path to building their family. Fertility Specialist and Reproductive Endocrinologist read Dr. Marie Werner from RMA New Jersey joined All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes to share what she’s learned about caring for her surrogacy patients during the global pandemic. Dr. Werner’s experience is particularly insightful as RMA New Jersey, like ConceiveAbilities, has remained open and active in guiding surrogacy journeys continuously through 2020. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take on Dr. Werner’s perspective. NF: How is COVID-19 impacting the surrogacy journey?“From the beginning, our practice really had a strong commitment to our patients and we know that fertility doesn’t wait. Building a family doesn’t wait, no matter really what’s going on in the world. We stayed open through it all and we have a really efficient system in place to make sure our patients feel that we’re doing everything in our power to limit exposure for every piece of the journey. There are always risks involved and it’s really important that our patients are aware of those risks before proceeding. Our patients have been very understanding of [our safety procedures] and I am appreciative of our relationship with our patients to get them to that point, because all of this is so emotional.” NF: Even though ASRM initially recommended pausing treatment back in March 2020, RMA New Jersey did not shut down during COVID. Why were you able to stay open?“I have a lot of respect for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. In such uncertain times, they were trying their best to offer patients the best guidance that they could. We have to remember that not every fertility center is the same. At the end of the day, patient autonomy is really important, especially when we’re talking about a situation where we know eggs don’t wait for us. We feel like fertility treatment is essential. Building a family is essential and we couldn’t take that away from the patients.” NF: What have you learned about surrogacy care during COVID-19?“Medical professionals, fertility providers and agencies like ConceiveAbilities are all working together to make sure we’re making this the safest journey possible, but we can’t eliminate all risks. I would encourage all these patients to have frank discussions with providers about their fears, their anxieties, so they can help manage those. The most important thing in all of this is communication and counseling. As long as you feel like your team is supporting you in those ways, you should move forward. Because again, time is not on our side when it comes to these treatments and we want you to have your family now, not a few years down the line.” NF: Is it safe to conceive during COVID-19?“Information is limited since we have only been dealing with this for the past ten months. The literature the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has put out says that it is still safe to conceive. No one is telling anybody not to conceive, but we are telling pregnant patients that they are considered a higher risk population and the CDC just updated that guideline as well. It is important for everybody to know that is the case and to try to limit exposures as much as possible.” NF: Should people wait to move forward with their surrogacy journey?“I don’t think waiting makes a ton of sense, given we just don’t know what will happen next. Even if COVID-19 goes away, there could be another virus next year, so I would encourage all of my patients to continue moving forward. And so while life is not perfect, I think that we have appropriate ways to manage care from a medical aspect where I don’t think people should be waiting to start this process.” NF: What has been your “aha” moment during Covid?“At the beginning of the pandemic when we kept our doors open, you saw all these lawn signs everywhere supporting our essential workers with a picture of the physician, the nurse, or the policemen. I got a small present delivered to the office from one of my patients that said, ‘Thank you for being an essential worker.’ I learned how important it is that we’re here and doing this everyday for our patients and continue to be here for them. I am really thankful for that patient for putting it into words, because that’s how we’ve been acting. We will keep our doors open and we’ll continue to help patients build their families without waiting and I think that’s the most important take home message. I don’t know how things are going to change, but we’re certainly always going to be at the forefront of making sure we provide our patients with evidence-based practices. A big part of that is realizing that fertility is an essential service and that we’re going to be here for them.” Have more questions? Please find more answers here, and do contact us to talk more.

    "content": "We often hear from both intended parents and surrogates that they would like to offer one another a symbol of hope and gratitude to mark the moments of their shared journey. These mementos may be shared at transfer day, during pregnancy, after the birth – and a special holiday like Mothers Day! They can range from homemade tokens to gift baskets to personalized items tailored specifically to the recipient. These are some of the creative gifts we have seen shared between intended parents and surrogates over the years. We hope they provide some inspiration for you! Jewelry Ideas If jewelry holds special meaning, we love the simplicity of this Kate Spade “heart of gold” bangle bracelet. You can also personalize your sentiments with a Giving Key necklace, bracelet, or earrings. For a unique twist, embrace the journey and choose from an array of jewelry with charms specific to fertility (think pineapples) from vendors like Alex and Ani or Luca and Danni. Sentimental Ideas If sentimentality is more your style, we suggest a combined surrogacy pregnancy journal as a way for you to all contribute to the pregnancy and birth story. A small figurine can serve as a daily reminder of why you’re pursuing this process together, and a keychain etched with the sound waves from the baby’s heartbeat can help minimize the miles between you. There are also unique prints that can be customized to represent where the surrogate lives, where the transfer occurred, and where the IPs live. And of course, some say a book can be the best gift. Take a look through our list of timeless surrogacy books. You just may find the perfect one for your surrogacy journey. Homemade Ideas As our #10 idea, we have a catchall category here to memorialize the creativity of incredible homemade gifts we have seen over time, whether thoughtfully customized onesies for the new addition(s), or gorgeously cozy quilts and knitted items. IPs sometimes create a post-transfer or post-birth gift basket for their surrogate full of their favorite snacks, books, and movies. Some surrogates have created a “Welcome to Parenthood” basket with items the IPs and baby won’t be able to live without. And don’t think that you need to spend a great deal to make an impact. We often hear that some of the most meaningful exchanges have been a heartfelt, handwritten letter or a sweet framed photo. You know your match best, and we encourage you to have fun with your gift-giving. If you need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out to your ConceiveAbilities team. Happy gifting!",

    "content": "Finding a path to parenthood by working with a gestational carrier continues to grow in its appeal. Surrogacy by the numbers In 2019, more than 10,000 births took place by surrogate in the United States, and the market is steadily growing at 15% per year based on data from the Centers for Disease Control. And, in 2019, 5.4% of all In Vitro Fertilization transfers occurred with a gestational carrier, which is up from just over 1% ten years prior. Surrogacy in the news The emotional appeal, though, is the real growth story of this modern approach to building families. Just last week, Anderson Cooper delivered a beautiful tribute to the power of surrogacy. Listen and watch his gripping commendation on CNN here. Anderson is the latest public face to share his feelings about how surrogacy has made his life more than he could have ever imagined. And we add our warmest welcome to Anderson’s newborn Wyatt. But there’s more. Andy Cohen, of Watch What Happens Live and Radio Andy, turned his joy in becoming a father with the help of a surrogate into passionate and effective advocacy to legalize compensated gestational surrogacy in New York. And, after a hard-fought battle, he and the great state of New York prevailed, as state-of-the-art legislation was just passed. Finally, for anyone who is finding the journey to parenthood to be challenging, hear from Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy Juvonen. Just last week, they shared their candid and raw emotions about what their path to parenthood involved. Jimmy and Nancy’s young daughters, both delivered via surrogate, are now routinely featured in The Tonight Show’s At Home Edition. Draw inspiration from Nancy’s words, amid the couple’s banter, as she describes her decision and determination to simply not quit, which made their beautiful family possible. Be a surrogate And, if you’ve ever thought that you could make that kind of miraculous difference for someone else, we encourage you to consider the possibilities. You can take a look at the process to get a better understanding of how to be a surrogate. But, even better, you can also talk with us. We know what it takes to be a surrogate and we know the difference you could make.",

    "content": "Whether you’re experiencing pregnancy conventionally or with the help of a surrogate, it’s not uncommon for fathers-to-be to feel a little out of the loop. In reality, Dad plays an important role in the process. Regardless of whether you are a single father or supporting your partner over the nine months, these pregnancy and parenting apps with tips for new dads, gay dads, and all dads that you’ve got this. Apps to help with the pregnancy Daddy Up is a one-stop shop for all things dad-to-be. It features weekly pregnancy progress, “rugged” baby-size comparisons, a customizable daddy checklist and journal log, plus tools to help you stay on top of contractions and baby announcements. Mom will be so impressed! Who’s Your Daddy uses humor as a means to help dads-to-be understand and relate to some of the common ailments of pregnancy such as middle of the night cravings. This Australian app offers weekly tips as well as updates on the baby’s development. ProDaddy breaks down some of the biggest pregnancy and baby-related topics into entertaining 3-minute reads. With weekly tips and Daddy Deep Dives, plus vetted resources on everything from insurance, postpartum health to childcare, it’s a helpful guide for first-time dads and seasoned pros alike. BabyCenter is another popular app whether you’re trying to conceive, pregnant, or adjusting to parenthood. It provides detailed weekly updates as well as parenting advice through the baby’s first year. There’s a contraction counter, plus a related app all about baby names that keeps Dad a regular contributor to the list. The Big Daddy was created by an actual dad who is an actual doctor. It helps dads-to-be keep track of baby’s development throughout the pregnancy with “the manliest size comparisons you’ve ever seen” – think tools and tomahawk steaks. It includes a built-in contraction timer, comprehensive checklists, and over 40 doctor-approved articles on all things pregnancy. The app is free, but offers a few additional features for a nominal fee. Full Term Contraction Timer was created by a new dad after his wife’s labor; he knows what you need, and what you don’t need, during that high anxiety time. It requires the tap of just one button at the start and end of the contraction, with great contrast and a clean layout. You don’t need this kind of app to be fancy, you just need it to work! Apps for when the little one arrives Quick Tips for New Dads is the ultimate survival guide for new dads, made by dads. It offers quick, practical advice and includes 250+ stress-busting tips, 11 essential how-to guides on things like bathing your baby, changing a diaper and sterilizing a bottle, 5 must-have checklists, and of course – The Weird Stuff Nobody Tells You About. Baby Manager is a must-have once the baby arrives. Baby tracker apps help record and chart feeding, whether bottle or breast, as well as sleep, diaper changes and more. It’s a great way to stay on top of these all-consuming activities with a newborn when sleep (and mental sharpness) is at an all-time low. Wonder Weeks is based on the best-selling book and more than three decades of international scientific research. It helps “keep you informed about the (mental) leaps and bounds of your baby,” which can explain why he or she is all sunshine and rainbows one day but completely inconsolable the next. It’s hard work growing into that new brain! Kinedu helps your baby learn and grow through play – something Dad is sure to have a huge role in. It offers thousands of fun development exercises personalized to your baby’s age and needs, and even factors in things like prematurity to meet your baby where they are and help them flourish. Educational apps Whether they’re utilized before or after baby arrives, apps are a fantastic way to learn on the go. First-time parents, in particular, can benefit from the wealth of information available right at their fingertips, day or night. While it’s no substitute for a medical professional, a baby development app might help you decipher whether your baby’s fever is the result of a cold or teething – and a bonus, it will remind you at what point you should involve the pediatrician. What’s more, educational apps can actually help you connect – whether it’s to your pregnant wife or your baby. Having those tools in your back pocket can go a long way in boosting confidence as a new dad. The effects of technology and parenting Technology and parenting truly go hand-in-hand, now more than ever. Utilizing digital tools helps both moms and dads stay more informed and engaged than ever before. Apps take some of the guesswork out of a situation that doesn’t come with an instruction manual; they offer digestible pieces of information during a period you simply don’t have time to sit down with a book. Aside from the educational component, technology also makes many aspects of parenting a lot more convenient. And, if the baby is refusing to sleep, download a white noise app to help you both rest easy. Parenting is no simple feat, but you’ll feel a lot more confident when you make technology work for you.

    "content": "What makes a family? Well, thanks to a rapidly evolving definition of the modern family, it can look many different ways. Ultimately, it includes parents and children who care about one another. Due to new laws, better technology and open minds, more and more same-sex partners are able to become fathers. We’ll explore the triumphs and challenges, as well as what makes two-dad families so special. What defines a father? Quite simply, a father is an individual who identifies as male and has at least one child. Whether or not he is the biological parent makes no difference; rather it is his commitment and involvement in the wellbeing of the child that truly makes someone a father. What is a father’s role? The role of a father cannot be overstated; his influence is one that helps a child grow and learn in unique ways. And because modern families can now be built around the role of a father, we celebrate these gifts that make the relationship between father and child so special. How do gay men become fathers? Thanks to modern technology, it is not only possible but also becoming more and more realistic for gay men to become fathers. Through processes like adoption and assisted reproductive technology, men have a variety of routes including surrogacy to try when building their families. Third party reproduction is the most direct way for at least one dad-to-be to have a genetic role. With the help of an egg donor, one man’s sperm can be combined with the donor egg and the subsequent embryo can be transferred to a surrogate mother, also known as a gestational carrier. Some couples opt to create multiple embryos with each male contributing genetic material; they may or may not know which embryo is ultimately transferred to create their child. Guidance from an informed fertility doctor, as well as the option of a genetic panel, can help gay couples make the best decision for their family creation process. Coupled with the right legal approach, parenthood is even more attainable. While laws vary from state to state and must be carefully reviewed for the protection of both the intended parents and surrogate, the hope is that all parties fully understand the process and what is expected of them from start to finish. That, along with a solid relationship, is the ultimate goal in this unique process. In an exciting new development for both same-sex and heterosexual couples, New York recently joined 47 other states in permitting compensated surrogacy. After decades of surrogacy being outlawed in New York, this state-of-the art law provides clear guidance about the surrogacy process, benefiting both intended parents and surrogates. While the law certainly breaks barriers for gay dads, the legal landscape adds unique complexities in what can already be a challenging process. What stigmas do gay dads face? Despite the promising combination of legal, medical and social advancements, gay dads and their families continue to experience stigma. A study published in the February 2019 issue of Pediatrics, the Official Journal of the American Society of Pediatrics, found that more than 60% of gay fathers experienced stigma in at least one context within the past year. According to the study, “the reported stigma occurred most often in the context of religious institutions, but some fathers also reported experiencing exclusion and discrimination at the hands of their families, neighbors and friends.” Natalia, who was a gestational surrogate for a same-sex couple, saw this firsthand and and it opened her eyes to the stigma gay dads face. “I have more knowledge about the discrimination they suffer, about how they need to fight for all their rights,” she explained. “It is sad how everything is more complicated for them and it is not fair.” Fortunately, modern laws protecting the LGBTQ community are slowly but surely having an impact. According to the research, the legal protections “have a meaningful link to the experience of gay fathers and their children.” In states with fewer legal protections, “both active and avoidant stigma were reported more frequently by fathers.” What do gay dads want you to know about their families? When it comes down to it, families with two dads aren’t so different from any other. Though special in their own ways, many common themes of family and parenthood ring true. Joseph Tito shared his surrogacy journey as a single gay man on our podcast A Single Dad’s Surrogacy Journey With Joseph Tito of The Dad Diaries. VeryWell Family also featured ConceiveAbilities intended dads, Kyle and Randy, who shared their surrogacy journey as gay men. “Our amazing gestational carrier lives in Colorado, and we would have never found her without the help of our incredible agency, ConceiveAbilities. We chose them as our agency mostly because of their “all-in” package, which made the logistical and financial aspects of our journey very easy and stress-free. Furthermore, we wanted access to a large and well-vetted pool of potential carriers. We needed to have a carrier in a state that is legally friendly to surrogacy, and moreover, a state with established precedence for legal parentage procedures for same-sex families.” How can gay dads find support? At ConceiveAbilities, we are proud advocates of the modern family. “To us, helping loving people become parents is why we do what we do,” explains Founder Nazca Fontes. Our team provides extensive support to all those who want to fulfill their destiny of parenthood and our in-house legal advisors understand the laws regarding surrogacy for gay couples.

    "content": "We are living in a new world, one where every day brings new challenges as we all grapple with the global pandemic of COVID-19. And yet, the desire to build a family is as strong and enduring as ever. That’s why we at ConceiveAbilities want to give you straight talk on some of your most commonly asked questions about your surrogacy journey at this most extraordinary time. We are determined to bring all of our multi-disciplinary skills to bear on helping others build families, especially now. Because, after all, family is everything. Is ConceiveAbilities still accepting surrogates and intended parents during the outbreak? Absolutely. Done well, these early steps of your journey take time, research and preparation, and can all be completed virtually from the comfort of your own home. As described in our process timeline, we pace these steps based on your needs – emotionally, physically, and financially. We are with you at each step. If, at any time and for any reason, you would like your process to be placed “on hold,” perhaps in consultation with your healthcare provider, we can make that so. And, if you would like to resume your journey, we can promptly do so and you’ll have your reserved place “in line,” so to speak. There are, of course, many disruptions to normal travel and clinic schedules. If those disruptions wind up impacting your journey, we feel that you will be in a strong position to continue your journey sooner if you start your onboarding process today. Should I meet with ConceiveAbilities now, or wait until after the outbreak subsides? We welcome having a conversation now to map out what your personal journey will look like. We believe, very strongly, that the more time you have to research and get to know us, and us you, the better. Because we have almost 25 years of experience with a tremendously loyal client following, we have a wide range of surrogates and intended parents to whom we can make introductions. There’s nothing better than speaking with someone who has been through the entire journey where you can learn from their stories and insights. And, as has been our practice for many years, we conduct all these activities virtually. While we love any chance to meet with you in person, we are highly practiced in leveraging the power of modern day technology to manage the surrogacy journey. You’ll find that our process is quite a thorough one. The more time you have to see us in action, the more you’ll find that the details and specificity of our approach makes all the difference to ensuring you have a successful journey. We value and respect the healthcare providers that you work with. And, we support your decisions as you make the safest and most responsible decisions about the timing of embryo transfers, and other medical procedures, to safeguard the health of surrogate mothers and babies. We offer no views of our own with regard to the prevailing guidelines and medical insights about the relationship between healthy pregnancies and COVID-19. We know your healthcare provider is the best source for that information. If your journey pauses for a period of time, so be it; we’re there with you and will expeditiously pick things back up as circumstances safely allow. Will COVID-19, and what is happening economically, have an impact on ConceiveAbilities? Yes, as is true for every business in the world. And we are ready. For ConceiveAbilities, we have consolidated our cases to a team approach, with the number of expert people we need to bring our full focus to the families we serve. We have streamlined our resources because we know this is how we ensure we have staying power through this time, for you and all of our clients. During these times, we’d encourage you – now more than ever – to work with ConceiveAbilities. We’ve successfully weathered the industry’s ups and downs over these last many years and have a strong reputation, a rock-solid foundation, devoted employees and a robust process. Those who know, know to work with our agency. Is becoming a surrogate a good way to earn extra income during and after this outbreak? Yes, it certainly can be. Establishing a safety net for your family, having money for a down payment on a home, or paying off student debt are all frequent benefits that our surrogates value from their compensation with ConceiveAbilities. And that’s only one of several motivators for our surrogates, who work from a common foundation of confidently empowering others to build a family who otherwise could not. That said, the surrogacy calling is not for everyone. Those that are accepted as surrogates at ConceiveAbilities succeed through a careful approval process. The intended parents you meet are just as carefully screened. With a 97% success rate after the first meeting, you can be confident that we know how to make matches that make sense. Do intended parents have certainty about what they will spend to build a family with ConceiveAbilities during this economic shift? Yes. With all that we’ve mentioned above, we know your financial investment in building your family is important to secure. With our generous All-In approach to capping your expenses, you know up front how much your family building journey will cost when you work with ConceiveAbilities. No surprises. As one clear example of this pledge at work, we will rematch you at no additional cost should your surrogate not pass medical clearance. Can ConceiveAbilities help Intended Parents to navigate clinic and other delays? Yes. With almost 25 years of experience, delays – while frustrating – are nothing new. We are already hard at it to tackle today’s challenges and see your journey to a successful conclusion. For instance, we are working closely with clinics to ensure they can review surrogate medical records and order preliminary tests as needed, prior to the scheduling of any medical workup.

    "content": "As you are aware, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is closely monitoring the developments of COVID-19, also known as novel coronavirus. While we cannot provide any medical advice, ConceiveAbilities is dedicated to staying up to date on the impact of this situation and anticipating the important questions and concerns you may have. Will COVID-19 have an impact on the scheduled embryo transfer and/or egg retrieval? At ConceiveAbilities, we are working to maintain up-to-date information with the clinics where your planned embryo transfer and/or egg retrieval is due to take place. The treating physician and IVF center are on point to assess the safety and health of the steps ahead. Decisions about medical care can only be made in connection with the attending physician and we encourage all parties to stay in close communication. Should travel plans for embryo transfer or egg retrieval be changed or reconsidered? This should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to risk factors and input from your IVF center. We ask all of our Intended Parents, Surrogates and Egg Donors to stay in touch with their treating IVF center for their latest updates and advice. Of note, updates may be provided to the patient first, before the agency. This is an important fact to understand, particularly during a time of increased time constraint for many medical professionals. If embryo transfer or retrieval is postponed, what does this mean? Please do not worry if this happens. ConceiveAbilities is committed to all of our matches and families and will support each through any period of delay. Any transfer or retrieval that is delayed due to medical advice or increased risk will be managed by our agency when the IVF center resumes a treatment schedule. The good news is that delays can be a normal part of treatment calendars and we are well-versed in the management of postponed cycles should additional time be necessary. Why is my ability to access my clinic disrupted? We want to share some information that may prove helpful. While it is not meant to provide medical guidance or drive healthcare decisions, we hope to help you better understand why the ability to continue your journey to build a family has potentially become delayed. The spread of COVID-19 is still not completely understood. We expect to continue to see an increase in cases as more testing comes online. In a way, this is a good thing as it’s allowing the exposure that already exists to become known, quantified and better managed by the state and local health professionals. The risk to any one of us, as an individual, even those that are older or have compromised immunity or travel on an airplane, is low. However, the exact opposite is true for local populations: because of the rapid increase in cases which can exceed the capacity of any given community’s health system to treat not just COVID-19, but many other illnesses. The primary public health strategy to lower this risk is to attempt to “flatten the curve” of how quickly this virus spreads. By doing so, the risk to any local population is reduced, for two reasons. One, there is greater capacity for health systems in that locale to attend to those individuals with this disease. Two, it buys time for the possibility of other treatments to come available and for the spread of the disease to wane. Hopefully you now have a better understanding for why we are all seeing such aggressive “protective measures” to continue to cancel, delay, and limit large gatherings of people. How will COVID-19 impact a pregnancy? The facts here are, no doubt, uncertain and based on extremely limited samples and studies. Of course, it’s optimal for any pregnancy that the mother is healthy throughout the entire pregnancy. Based on all currently available data about COVID-19, however, the risk that a pregnant woman can pass a COVID-19 infection to an unborn baby appears to be quite low. Further, the risk of a severe COVID-19 infection is clearly and repeatedly connected with factors that are unlikely to apply to a gestational carrier, specifically age, the presence of other health conditions, gender, and a history of smoking or vaping. Of note, The majority of individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 are more than 45 years old Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung disease, cancer, and chronic kidney disease have each been associated with risk of a more severe infection. In a subset of 355 patients who died with COVID-19 in Italy, the mean number of other health conditions was 2.7, and only 3 patients had no underlying condition. The gestational carriers that work with ConceiveAbilities must be able to successfully demonstrate that these health issues do not apply to them. Men have a disproportionately high number of deaths from COVID-19. Smoking and vaping are both additional risk factors and these factors would also disqualify a potential gestational carrier. Looking forward While it is breathtakingly simple, the most important steps we can all take are to (a) wash our hands, thoroughly, and (b) not touch our eyes, noses, or mouths. This advice is based on the continued consistent understanding that the main mode of transmission of this virus is through the passing of a respiratory droplet from one person to another. If you find that wearing a cloth mask, scarf, bandana, glasses or gloves helps you not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth, then by all means you should wear a cloth mask, scarf, bandana, glasses, or gloves. This situation is new ground for all of us and continues to evolve.. We are committed to you and your journey and will do everything we can for the surrogates, egg donors and intended parents that make up the ConceiveAbilities family. We believe that family is everything and we are with you every step of the way as you build yours. Please contact us with any questions that you may have.",

At ConceiveAbilities, we are expert at navigating the delays, financial up-and-downs, medical system complexities, and travel vagaries that are required to complete a successful family-building journey. The reason we do it is for the end result. For instance, just yesterday, a healthy baby was delivered in Houston by a wonderful surrogate for a couple that had spent years working toward that very moment. To put it mildly, there had been setbacks along the way. And yet, the aim was achieved with this gorgeous new life now part of a budding family. Even during some very concerning days, much joy and happiness is found and embraced. The desire to create a family is a strong one and it causes you and it causes us to find our way through those challenges. The current global pandemic with COVID-19 certainly brings this all into focus. You should know that we are more determined than ever to be your partner through this journey. And, as events unfolded this week, it’s caused us to reflect on four short beliefs: First, we believe in the doctors and care providers that you are working with. They have wisdom, your best interests and sound medical advice to provide. Second, we believe in the power of informed consent. You are a shared decision-maker in this journey together with your healthcare providers. You have instincts about what’s best, and the decisions ahead of you should include those instincts. Third, we believe in our staying power. We have navigated countless challenges throughout our 25 years as a company and we are certain that those experiences will continue to directly serve you as we all stay focused on your ultimate aim. Lastly, we believe family is everything. Now more than ever. Meanwhile, it can be hard for any of us to maintain equilibrium through these times. Some may feel that the current actions by governments around the world are over done, and some may feel that they are under done. You are surely subjected to a flurry of inbox updates and it can be very hard to stay current or to look for clues on how to best continue forward. Regardless, we are here for you and will partner with you to find the best path for your circumstances. In order to maintain connection, but without overloading your inbox, we will plan for a communication in this format (a short note sometimes directly from me to you, sometimes as a simple update from the company as a whole) once per week. If we have a view on a more urgent development, you’ll hear from us sooner, particularly from your main point person you are already engaged with at ConceiveAbilities. And, if we have nothing meaningful to add to the state of affairs, it will just be a short note to let you know we are thinking of you. And, most importantly, because each match is different, mass communication does not suffice about the needs of your personal journey. Your Match Manager is available to address your individual questions and concerns, and act as a continued source of guidance and support. At all times, please continue to call and email us at any time. Our team, like many organizations, is working safely from home with good technologies to support us in staying productive. We have reviewed all the hand-washing videos, and CDC guidance, and the like. We are ready. Best,Nazca FontesCEO, ConceiveAbilities",

    "content": "Endometriosis can often be a very misunderstood and often misdiagnosed medical condition even though it affects one in ten women and 30% to 50% of women who deal specially with an infertility diagnosis. In recent years, many female celebrities such as Lena Dunham, Julianne Hough, Jillian Michaels, Padma Lakshmi, Daisy Ridley, Tia Mowry-Hardrict and Halsey have all opened up about their own endometriosis diagnosis in the hopes that it raises awareness and helps others like themselves. Making matters more frustrating, endometriosis is sometimes mistaken for other conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ovarian cysts. It may also be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In other cases, 20–25% of patients are completely asymptomatic. This is why the more familiar you become with this condition and its symptoms, the more you can advocate on your own behalf. Still, just because you have endometriosis doesn’t mean you may not conceive on your own as it’s entirely possible you can still get pregnant naturally. However, you should always feel comfortable seeking the advice or insight of your OB/GYN or even make an appointment with a Reproductive Endocrinologist if you feel you need some extra support or guidance. On that note, if you do get pregnant, some women report that pregnancy actually relieves some of the symptoms of endometriosis. It’s important to mention though that pregnancy does not “cure” the disease as much as it offers a respite. Still, it would be a welcome break! Can endometriosis cause permanent infertility? Each case of endometriosis can vary woman to woman and the same goes for the severity of symptoms and the impact it has on her fertility. Some women, as we mentioned, may be able to conceive on her own and some may need reproductive technology to help her expand her family. While it can seem intimidating or overwhelming to consider using infertility treatment to conceive, when you consider that it changes the question from “if” I’ll have a family to “how” I’ll have a family, things seem more hopeful. The bottom line, while it may potentially impact your fertility, you always have options like IVF, surrogacy, adoption and more to consider. How does endometriosis affect implantation? When you’re trying to conceive, the embryo that’s created needs to implant itself into the uterine lining to achieve a successful pregnancy. As you learn and understand more about endometriosis and how the uterine lining may or may not be compromised, you may be concerned about whether an embryo (whether it’s created through natural conception or IVF) may be unable to implant. In a study done by Yale University on this exact concern, it did show in some cases there might be a lower implantation rate. However, reproductive technology is constantly evolving and recently, a new test emerged that looks at endometrial receptivity that can offer the optimal time to transfer an embryo. Does endometriosis affect IVF success rates? There are a lot of factors when it comes to answering this question. It depends on the severity of the endometriosis, how it was treated previously (meaning, if surgical measures such as laparoscopy was used prior to the IVF cycle) and how much time has lapsed in between surgery and the IVF cycle. A study was done about this exact topic by The Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology and overall, the biggest factor appears to be how intense the endometriosis is. This is another reason why early diagnosis and intervention, if at all possible, can be incredibly helpful. What is the treatment for endometriosis? Typically, depending on how severe the endometriosis is suspected to be, the first lines of defense are over the counter pain medications like Advil, Motrin, Naproxen or Aleve. Hormone treatments are an option as well such as birth control pills. In general, these treatments aren’t always sufficient for endometriosis since diagnosis tends to require surgical confirmation. Surgical options range from the earlier mentioned laparoscopy to a slightly more invasive procedure called a laparotomy. Typically, a skilled surgeon can diagnose and treat endometriosis with minimally invasive techniques. Does treating endometriosis increase fertility? Depending on the course of action taken, surgical intervention may help. With endometriosis, there really is no, “one size fits all” and that’s why getting the proper diagnosis and having your treatment specially tailored to you is what will help you have the best possible outcome not just to potentially increasing your fertility, but to having a healthy pregnancy and child. In the end, educating yourself, keeping track of your cycle and the corresponding symptoms, partnering with an expert clinic and persistence can make a tremendous difference.

    "content": "One of the most frequently asked questions we receive from women considering egg donation is, “How will donating eggs affect my body?” The fact is, the answer to this will vary from donor to donor. There are, however, a few aspects that are quite typical during the egg donor process that should be taken into consideration. From both a physical and emotional standpoint, short and long term, we will explore some of the most common things you can expect as an egg donor. Physical changes## The majority of the physical changes an egg donor might experience are related to medication in the weeks leading up to the retrieval, as well as the retrieval itself. If a donor is not already on some form of birth control, specifically the pill or Nuvaring, she will be instructed to take it in the weeks leading up to the injectable medications. This is to stabilize the donor’s hormones in order to take the subsequent egg donor medications. For about 7-10 days of the injectable medication cycle, most donors take what is called FSH, which stimulates and matures the eggs for retrieval. From there, a donor will take GnRH Antagonist for about 4-5 days; this is to prevent the premature release of hormones during the cycle. The final step is human chorionic gonadotropin, also known as the hCG “trigger shot.” This crucial step, taken about 36-40 hours before the retrieval, is what fully matures the eggs before they are retrieved. The retrieval itself often results in some minor bloating and abdominal cramping; these symptoms typically subside within a couple days and should fade completely by the time you get your next menstrual period. Potential side effects and how to manage them While you won’t be able to see the internal physical changes (though the ultrasound will certainly pick them up), it’s possible that you may experience some physical side effects. Birth control can potentially cause nausea, breast tenderness, temporary weight gain, mood changes and decreased libido. Side effects from the injectable medication can be similar, with bloating, mood changes, hot flashes, headaches, fatigue and temporary weight gain as the most common side effects. Rarely, they can lead to injection skin site reactions, ovarian twisting or Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS). As you approach the retrieval and take your final “trigger shot,” you may experience mood changes, hot flashes or headaches. Keep in mind that one of the major priorities of your regular monitoring appointments is watching how your body is responding to the medication. If there is any sign that you are over (or under) responding to the medication, the cycle will be cancelled. One of the simplest ways to help manage any physical side effects from egg donation is allowing for plenty of rest. Your body is working hard to produce extra eggs during this time, and you may naturally feel more fatigued. Put the brakes on any vigorous physical activity – you will be instructed by your nurse coordinator on exactly what this means for you, but in general you’ll want to limit exercise to walking and light stretching while you’re taking the injections. Plan to take the day off from work or school for the actual retrieval; while some women feel “back to normal” right away, most find that allowing for a full day of rest makes their overall recovery much smoother. Fortunately, the long term impact of egg donation appears to be positive. According to a study over the course of 11 years that was recently published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), most donors report continuing good health following egg donation. Emotional changes While we explored the physical changes that could be brought on by egg donation, it’s important to address the emotional changes as well. Some of these are actually similar – mood changes, for example, can be brought on by the medications and are extremely common. However, you’ll find that they dissipate soon after the retrieval. Other emotional changes you might experience as a donor are often related to stress. Some women find that they struggle initially with time management and isolation, and that can make the process feel daunting. Add in the influx of hormones, and it can be a challenging time if left untreated. Potential side effects and how to manage them By prioritizing your emotional wellbeing as much as your physical wellbeing, many of these emotional side effects can be managed. Before you even become an egg donor, consider your support system. Are there a few people in your life you can discuss your plan with? Who can you count on to offer you some moral support and encouragement? Keep in mind that your clinic nurse coordinator and ConceiveAbilities Match Manager are also available to answer questions and provide support throughout your journey. While egg donation may cause you to experience some physical and emotional changes, know that most are minor and very temporary.

    "content": "While in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of fertility treatment, there are several less invasive, less expensive options your doctor may want to explore. Clomid pills have been a popular choice amongst intended parents for more than 50 years. While it certainly boasts longevity in a field that has rapidly evolved in the past several decades, there are both pros and cons to taking this little pill. Pro: Clomid can regulate or induce ovulation. Thanks to clomiphene citrate, known as Clomid and also sold generically under other brand names like Serophene, millions of women have become pregnant since it first hit the market in 1967. The oral pill works to regulate or induce ovulation, stimulating the number of hormones that support the growth and release of a mature egg in women who are not ovulating regularly enough to get pregnant. The typical protocol is a 50mg dose per day on days 3 to 7 of the menstrual cycle, though precise treatment will vary by individual. Most women will ovulate 7 to 10 days after taking Clomid pills, which means you’re most likely to conceive on days 11 through 21 of your cycle. Statistics indicate that when taken as directed, the success rate of clomid shows 80 percent of women will respond to the treatment and successfully ovulate on Clomid. Con: It doesn’t identify other potential fertility issues. Clomid strictly addresses ovulation; if that is the only barrier preventing a woman from becoming pregnant, it’s likely that she’ll have success with Clomid. The problem is that this particular treatment doesn’t address other potential issues. Infertility can be related to anything from egg quality to low sperm count to structural complications and beyond; if there are additional factors at play, Clomid alone will not get you any closer to pregnancy. Before you start Clomid as a fertility treatment, your doctor should complete full diagnostic testing and an ultrasound to help rule out other obvious problems. Pro: Clomid is successful as a first treatment option. If a woman is in the early stages of fertility treatment, Clomid is a natural first choice. It is recommended to take Clomid when a woman is in the early stages of fertility treatment. It can be a non-invasive option; some women are able to conceive without intervention after a round of Clomid, bypassing the need for additional treatment. Others who successfully ovulate with Clomid are able to achieve pregnancy when the treatment is followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI), where sperm is transferred directly into the uterus. Con: The success rates haven’t changed over time. While the rate of ovulation is high, what are the chances of getting pregnant on Clomid? The rate of conception varies depending on a number of factors, including age and diagnosis. A woman under 35 with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), for example, has about a 15 percent chance of pregnancy per cycle assuming all other factors are normal. While advanced reproductive technology (ART) rates have steadily improved over time, results with Clomid alone remain stagnant. Without other obvious factors impeding fertility it can be a good option, but be sure to have a thorough discussion with your doctor regarding Clomid’s success rates before you start treatment. Pro: Clomid can be prescribed by your general practitioner or gynecologist. Unlike most fertility treatment, Clomid can be completed under the supervision of your gynecologist. Some women prefer to take this first step before meeting with a specialist to pursue a more rigorous form of treatment. It’s important to have a solid understanding of your particular situation before trying to conceive with Clomid; your doctor should first complete thorough testing or refer you to a reproductive endocrinologist to review your options. Con: You don’t have the expertise of a reproductive endocrinologist. If you’re trying to get pregnant, you probably wanted to get pregnant yesterday. A reproductive endocrinologist is the most qualified person to help you do that. It’s recommended that if you’re under the age of 35 and have been trying for a year without success you should see a specialist; over 35 should wait only 6 months. A reproductive endocrinologist has the experience and the tools to help you identify the best course of action; whether that’s Clomid or a more aggressive form of treatment, you’ll know that you’re using your time, energy and finances wisely. Like any medication, Clomid can also have side effects; clomiphene citrate, the synthetic estrogen found in Clomid, can cause mood swings, irritability, anxiety and sleep interruptions, as well as other physical side effects like bloating, hot flashes and headaches. The side effects of Clomid are relatively similar to those in other fertility medications, and some won’t experience issues at all. A fertility clinic’s staff will be best able to prepare you for your treatment protocol and potential side effects.

    "content": "If you’re thinking of becoming a gestational carrier, you’re already a special human! To consider helping an individual or couple build their family through surrogacy is both compassionate and generous. Even if you’re being paid to be a surrogate you’re taking on not just a physical commitment, but one that will involve a significant part of your life, all to assist someone in finally realizing their dream of parenthood. Anyone who has done research around surrogacy knows that there are requirements you’ll need to meet. However, below we share just a few of the qualities that go beyond age, BMI and other important factors to ensure a positive, healthy surrogacy process for all! You have a support system for your surrogacy journey You are surrounded by equally as compassionate and understanding friends, family, spouse, partner, work colleagues and even other “surrogacy sisters” who can be a support system. They can perhaps, drive you to appointments (if you need it), pitch in around the house, join you when you want or/need a pedicure or simply let you vent if you’re having some of the aches and pains that can happen during a pregnancy. You enjoy being pregnant There are women who say they never feel better than when they are pregnant. Their skin looks great, they have more energy, their hair is thicker and shinier, etc. If you are one of these lucky women, you might want to consider being a surrogate for someone who is unable to carry their own child. You are open-minded As we all know, people have strong opinions about surrogacy. Whether it’s someone’s personal beliefs, religion, sexual orientation or marital status concern, everyone has their own ethics to live by. However, when you’re considering gestational surrogacy, you respect everyone’s opinions and principles, but you have an open-mind to different lifestyles and support their right to have a family. You are empathetic While you may or may not understand the struggle of infertility or the many emotions one may have about not being able to carry their own child, you can appreciate and empathize with the desire to be a parent. Perhaps it’s the love you have for your own children that motivates you to recognize that others may want to experience that same kind of love and bond. You are healthy and take care of yourself You are being asked to carry one of the most precious gifts ever. For intended parents, the health of their future child and the woman carrying their baby are paramount. If you’re the kind of person who is reliable, attends appointments on time, takes the necessary precautions and is an overall responsible person, intended parents can breathe a little easier knowing they can rely on you to take care of yourself and their child. You are dependable and conscientious Taking care of yourself and your health is, of course, vital. But also, being organized enough to know what doctor appointment is when, how to fill out paperwork and to provide whatever else is needed for the process is essential. While no one can control EVERY pregnancy, reducing the unexpected and staying organized can help everyone’s stress level (including yours). When you begin the matching process to find an Intended Parent to work with, these qualities will absolutely come in handy. However, it’s important to note that there are many other factors that go into matching intended parents with gestational carriers. Therefore, ConceiveAbilities works tirelessly to take into account everyone’s personal preferences and comfort level while ensuring seamless communication between everyone. Matching Matters helps our goal to help create what may be the most rewarding experience of your lives.

    "content": "As you research egg donation, you’ve no doubt encountered a list of eligibility requirements. If you currently smoke or have in the past, you may be wondering if it disqualifies you. While the short answer is yes – smoking and nicotine use are prohibited in egg donation – we’ll explore the reasons why it impacts your egg quality and overall eligibility. Health Requirements to be a Donor We require our donors to meet certain medical qualifications: Have regular monthly periods No reproductive disorders or abnormalities Physically and emotionally healthy Non-nicotine user, non-smoker, non drug-user, no vaping, no psychotropic drug use Not currently on Depo-Provera shot or using the Implanon/Nexplanon arm implant Willing to undergo medical and psychological evaluation We also require some personal qualifications for our donors, such as aged between 21-28 and an ability to respond promptly to communication from ConceiveAbilities and clinic staff. Our donor applicants must also have the ability to be part of the donor pool for 6 months. It is important that you continue to meet these requirements throughout this time, including abstaining from smoking and nicotine. You can, however, be a former smoker and still be a qualified surrogate. Here’s a great way to learn more: How does smoking impact my eggs? Smoking and tobacco products damage the genetic material in eggs. There are also many chemicals in tobacco products that can speed up how quickly eggs are lost. Nicotine and carbon monoxide, for example, impact how quickly eggs die off, and they cannot be replaced once they are lost. In addition to speeding up egg loss, smoking can impact your egg quality and the ovarian function necessary to be a successful donor. Ovarian stimulation, or follicular recruitment, is used to help donors produce multiple eggs through hormone administration. Smoking can have a detrimental impact on how you respond to this important part of the donor process. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, female smokers need more ovary-stimulating medications during IVF and still have fewer eggs at retrieval, and infertility rates are about twice as high with smokers compared to nonsmokers. Smoking and smokeless tobacco products can both have the same effect on egg quality and overall fertility, so it is important to steer clear of anything that falls into this category during all stages of the egg donor process. Can I smoke marijuana if it is legal in my state? No. There is not as much scientific evidence of exact clinical impacts of marijuana on fertility, but there are other risks associated with using marijuana if you are considering becoming an egg donor. Studies have shown that marijuana use can interfere with ovulation and other reproductive functions. The active ingredient in marijuana, THC, interferes with the brain’s endocannabinoid system, which can change how the brain and reproductive organs communicate. In other words, it can throw your reproductive functions off balance. It is widely agreed in the medical community that more research is needed to determine the exact impacts of marijuana on fertility, eggs, and overall health. Since there is research already indicating that marijuana use impacts ovulation cycles, abstaining from marijuana is an important qualification to become a donor. If you are using marijuana for medical reasons and are still considering egg donation, speak with your doctor and team at ConceiveAbilities to discuss your unique circumstances. Can I vape if I want to be a donor? No. Vaping liquid includes many of the same chemicals and side effects as cigarettes and other nicotine products, so it is important to abstain from vaping if you are considering applying to become an egg donor. Can I become a donor if I quit smoking? It depends. Fertility starts to improve as soon as you quit smoking. Donation agencies vary, but many will allow you to apply to become a donor after three months of not smoking or using tobacco products. Depending on how long and how heavily you smoked, you may need to wait longer for your egg quality to improve enough to donate, or you may not be eligible to be a donor. While quitting smoking can improve your fertility over time, the loss of egg supply is irreversible. The short and long term impacts of smoking vary among women, so you might have regular nicotine testing as part of your process to become a donor. It is also important to be up front with your team at ConceiveAbilities from the beginning about your history with smoking to ensure a safe and secure situation for everyone. Remember, the intended parents are counting on your honesty and commitment to this crucial aspect of the process. There may be other long-term effects of smoking that can impact your qualifications to become a donor, such as your overall physical and emotional health. It’s no secret that smoking has many side effects outside of fertility, including higher risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Your doctor can help you determine if any other smoking related health concerns should be considered as you think about becoming an egg donor. Can I reapply to become a donor? Of course. If there were certain factors that caused your application to be rejected, like family medical history or an unsuccessful cycle, we still may not be able to help you become an egg donor but we may be able to work with you to become a surrogate. If your application was initially rejected based on more modifiable factors like your birth control method or availability, you can may now be a successful egg donor. What resources are available to help me quit smoking? If you are a current smoker or tobacco user, your doctor is the best resource to help you develop a plan to quit smoking safely. There are also many organizations on national and local levels that commit to helping smokers and tobacco users quit. Online resources and communities are available to help support you and develop a plan to reach your goals. Using techniques like patches can be helpful to quit in the long term, but remember that you’ll need to be free of any nicotine products before you apply to be an egg donor. We are proud to select the most committed egg donors who meet our strict criteria. Because smoking and tobacco products, as well as marijuana, can all have an impact on your overall egg quality and reproductive cycles, the requirement to be a non-smoker and non-nicotine user is important. Our team at ConceiveAbilities is here to talk through your individual circumstances and help you determine if egg donation, and potentially surrogacy, is the right path for you.",

    "content": "As you learn more about helping intended parents build their families, you may be wondering how surrogacy could impact plans to grow your own family. Having a biological child after surrogacy is not uncommon, and planning for your family’s future is an important consideration as you start your surrogacy journey. Can I have a baby after being a surrogate?## Yes. Many of our surrogates go on to complete a sibling journey (a second pregnancy with the same family), become a repeat surrogate for a different family, or become pregnant with their own baby. Surrogacy and traditional pregnancy are different in many ways – the support you get through your agency and the fact that the baby you’re carrying is not biologically yours are the most obvious. But despite these differences, they physical impact is the same. Your ability to carry a baby doesn’t change simply because you were a surrogate. It’s still important, however, to think about your long-term family building plans. Speaking with your doctor can be a good first step. If you are reaching an age where it might become harder to conceive, for example, your doctor can discuss if having a baby after surrogacy will be a safe option for you. They can also help you to identify any potential risks throughout your surrogacy in the event you do try to conceive again. It’s also important to make sure you and your partner, if you have one, are aligned. Surrogacy is a yearlong commitment, at minimum, so being on the same page about your timeline and plans to grow your family is imperative. Every surrogate’s path is unique, and your doctor is your best resource to answer questions about your individual circumstances and how they relate to future pregnancies. Are there medical or other risks associated with surrogacy? Medical A surrogate pregnancy carries essentially the same risks associated with carrying and giving birth to your own child. These risks can include everything from morning sickness and back pain to potentially more serious concerns like hypertension and gestational diabetes. The medical risks specific to surrogacy are generally minor. For example, you may experience bruising or a minor allergic reaction to IVF medications, or slight bleeding or cramping after the embryo transfer. These side effects are common, but it’s still important to keep your doctor and agency up to speed on these and any other reactions your body has throughout your surrogacy so they can best support you. Emotional One of the most common questions around surrogacy is if the surrogate mother develops an attachment to the baby. Will she find it hard to give the baby back to the intended parents? The reality is that most surrogates don’t give it a second thought. Our screening process ensures that surrogates are motivated by a genuine desire to help their intended parents. Surrogates echo that their intention in the journey makes it easy to avoid these concerns about attachment. Of course, your match manager and in house licensed mental health team are here to help you navigate emotions that may arise during or after your pregnancy. It can help to consider how this might impact your long-term family building plans. Do I need to tell my match manager if I plan to become pregnant again?## It’s best to keep your match manager informed of your plans so they can provide the best support throughout your journey. You may not know going into your surrogacy whether or not you plan to have another baby afterwards, and that’s just fine. But if you know that another pregnancy is something you are striving for, it’s helpful to keep your team at ConceiveAbilities in the loop for several reasons. First, we are here to support you in every way we can throughout every step of your journey. Being aware of your goal to have another baby gives us a better opportunity to provide specific support you may need during your surrogacy. Additionally, this is important to factor in the matching process. We take pride in creating successful matches (with a 97% first time match rate!) because of the many factors considered. One consideration might be a sibling journey to follow the first surrogacy. This match wouldn’t be the best fit if you are hoping to get pregnant with your own baby shortly after. Let your match manager know as your plans evolve; it helps keep everyone in the best place possible to provide the support and resources you need. Final considerations It’s important to think about your plans for growing your family as you consider becoming a surrogate. Your doctor and team at ConceiveAbilities have extensive experience helping navigate questions or concerns about pregnancy after surrogacy. And remember, you will also have a network of support in your surrogate sisters to share experiences and advice. If you are ready to take the next step, reach out! We are here to help every step of the way.",

    "content": "Going through in vitro fertilization (IVF) can be overwhelming. Understanding the process, the medications, potential side effects, and accepting that medical intervention, needles and in some cases, the help of a gestational carrier is necessary to build your family – it can take a toll. In this blog, we’ll provide an overview of IVF, what purpose the medication serves, plus some tips for taking the medications and any concerns you should be on the lookout for. An overview of IVF and IVF stimulation A healthy female typically produces a follicle that contains an egg every month. These follicles grow in your ovary and when released, it’s known as ovulation. If you’re pursuing IVF, however, you are prescribed injectable medications that aim to increase the number of follicles that will develop over a single cycle. More eggs mean a greater likelihood of multiple embryos. The goal, of course, is to ultimately increase your chances of IVF success. You will be carefully monitored through blood work and ultrasounds during this time. This is to observe the follicle size and your estradiol blood level to monitor the estrogen in your system. When your doctor determines that your follicle is at a size indicating the eggs are mature, they will be retrieved using a laparoscopic technique. Follicles are viewed using ultrasound and then a very thin needle is inserted into the follicle to retrieve each egg. Based on how well you respond to the fertility medications, the number of eggs retrieved can vary. Any mature eggs are then fertilized with the partner’s (or a donor’s) sperm. After the egg retrieval you are contacted with the fertilization results, or the number of eggs that became an embryo. Depending on your treatment protocol (if you’re doing a fresh or frozen transfer), the highest quality embryo is transferred to your uterus or your surrogate when your physician feels the time is ideal. If you are using a surrogate, she would have her own set of medications for the cycle. The medication used for IVF Bravelle,® Follistim,® Gonal-F,® Menopur® and Repronex® are the most commonly used brand names of injectable medications. These are known as gonadotropins, which means, “any of a group of hormones secreted by the pituitary which stimulates the activity of the gonads.” All these medications are used to stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple follicles. Your doctor will prescribe the ones he or she feels will be the most helpful for your situation and diagnosis. However, it’s worth noting that these medications are very similar and can be used interchangeably. Every individual and/or couple is responsible for the administration of these medications. Your clinic will teach you how to give these injections (or if you prefer, your partner can administer it). Some commonly reported side effects to gonadotropins are the following: • Fatigue• Mood swings• Discomfort at the injections site• Headaches• Ovarian hypersensitivity (which is why you’ll be closely monitored) Tips to using injectable fertility medications Once you know what medication you’ll be taking and how to inject yourself, here is a list of things you’ll want to have on hand to prepare: • A Band-Aid (or two, just in case)• Antibacterial soap• Cotton balls and alcohol or alcohol swabs• Vials of medication• Vials of diluent• Syringes and needles (use the type and size recommended by your reproductive endocrinologist)• Sharps container to dispose of used needles How to prepare yourself and the area to take an injection: • Choose a flat surface in your home to set up• Clean the surface with alcohol and let air dry• Wash your hands with antibacterial soap• Set up your medication and supplies on the flat surface In order to help minimize any pain or discomfort, the following tricks and tips are often recommended: • Apply ice to the injection site 30 to 60 seconds before to help numb the area• Make certain that air bubbles are removed from the syringe before injecting• Wait until alcohol on skin has evaporated• Mix up the site where you inject your medication to prevent one area from getting sore• Inject medications when they are at room temperature (especially for progesterone in oil)• Use a quick dart-like motion when putting in the needle• Avoid changing direction of the needle once it’s in• Warm compresses can help soreness of injection afterwards All of the above are suggestions and do not replace any instructions you’ve been given by your reproductive endocrinologist, nurse or medical team. Once the injection(s) are complete, discard any used needles, syringes and vials into your “sharps container”. This container is categorized as “medical waste” so it can be disposed of properly. Let your clinic know when the container is full. Some other important things to note regarding injectable medications: • The needles used for the injections must be sterile• Do NOT reuse any needles• Do not leave any needles lying around or dispose of them in your regular trash Injections are usually done over a span of 10 days. If you prefer, you can hire a nurse to give your injections or a friend or relative can be taught. Once the ultrasound and estradiol levels confirm mature follicles (eggs), your reproductive endocrinologist will determine when you are ready to receive the next injection, called human chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). This is to induce ovulation for your egg retrieval. The final stage is when the embryo(s) are transferred. You or your surrogate may be prescribed progesterone in oil (PIO). Progesterone in oil helps thicken the uterine lining to help the embryo and allow it to develop. As always, if you have medical concerns, you should speak to your doctor.

    "content": "It’s the moment you’ve been waiting for longer than you can remember – your baby is here! And while you’ve undoubtedly shared your gratitude with your surrogate mother for the irreplaceable role she played in this journey, you may wonder how your paths continue from here. It can be difficult to know exactly how your relationship with your surrogate will look after the baby is born. The birth and months that follow, adjusting as parents and as a growing family, can be emotionally charged. This is why it’s important to consider how you envision this already unique relationship post-birth. Your match, your way First, remember that your match can be whatever you want it to be – during the pregnancy and afterward, too. Your agency will discuss the possibilities prior to your match and will encourage this dialogue during the match meeting with your surrogate as well. It may be difficult to envision getting to the other side of this journey, but that’s why it is important to have an open, honest dialogue from the beginning. Consider whether you realistically plan to remain in contact with your surrogate. For some, that means a photo may be exchanged here and there, but the relationship is primarily for the duration of the pregnancy. In other situations, contact may be more consistent. Regardless of the relationship, it’s important to allow your surrogate proper closure. Why you should consider keeping a relationship with your surrogate mother Birth changes everything, for your family and for your surrogate. The end of the surrogacy journey requires lots of preparation and regular communication. After the baby is born, the parents are understandably busy and communication naturally drops off. The postpartum period without a baby, however, can be a difficult, jarring shift in responsibility. After all, your surrogate’s previous pregnancies all concluded in caring for a newborn. While some surrogates see this as a welcome relief (no middle of the night feedings!) for others it can lead to a confusing mix of emotions. That’s not to say there is any regret. “The most common questions were definitely ‘how are you going to feel about giving up the baby?’ and ‘wasn’t that hard to give up the baby?’” recalls Amanda, a former surrogate. “I would always explain that I wasn’t giving up a baby, I never had a baby to begin with. I would try my best to explain that there were two parents who love the baby so much, have been waiting for this baby, have been there the whole pregnancy – it is their baby!” Amanda, who completed a sibling journey for her intended fathers a couple of years later, had no doubt about the highlight of her experience. “Definitely spending the two summers with my IPs,” she says. Because they were an international couple, they spent more time locally around the delivery than other matches. “We really got to spend a lot of time together and get to know each other.” This unique time together is not the case for every match, but for those who experience it, it can help ease the transition. “Your life is different overnight after putting a year or more of yourself into this process,” explains Lori Jurecko, LSW, who has the unique perspective of a mental health professional, ConceiveAbilities Match Manager and former surrogate. “The relationship with the IPs has to change. That’s the natural course of things.” Intended parents often recognize this as well, and Lori notes that they may be “concerned for her, that she’s going to have a hard time. They ask, ‘how can we help her with that, what can we do?’” Tips to keep communication open## The match meeting between intended parents and surrogate lays the foundation for shared expectations and strong communication. The more you can share and discuss about your preferences here, the better. Keep in mind that these needs may change and evolve throughout the journey, which is why communicating with your match manager and surrogate directly is crucial. After the baby is born, it is important to remember that your surrogate may experience some level of grief. It’s not the loss of a child – she always understood this is your baby – but the loss of the experience. Surrogacy is a profound journey, one that changes her life too. To feel a variety of emotions at the culmination of this process is healthy and completely normal. Small gestures make a big impact during this stage. Simply offering your surrogate time to hold the baby, take a photo together or give her children the opportunity to meet the baby can mean the world to her. She may not ask for these things. Perhaps she isn’t sure how, or she doesn’t want to make you uncomfortable. By offering, you give both her and her family some closure and a chance for the journey to come full circle. For surrogate Nicole, spending time post-birth with her intended parents was priceless. “We had known each other, but there was just something deeper about it at that point. It was nice to have time with them, see them with Parker. Just to watch them with her, it was really good for my soul,” she recalls. One of the most powerful moments of the entire journey occurred with the new mom just before the new parents took Parker home. “There were no words exchanged, but the look that was between us…you could just tell there was a bond that was deeper than I was going to have with any other friend,” she says of the new mom. Even now, the memory is profoundly emotional. “That moment between Sam and I, sitting on my bed, is in the top five moments I’ve ever had in my whole life.” Boundaries on surrogate mother/intended parent relationships## At the start of the process, concerns about attachment can be a real thing for many intended parents. But is this a reason to put boundaries on communication? “I think that’s the distinction between surrogates and people who are not,” Lori explains. “They have more difficulty understanding that surrogates not only don’t develop that attachment or have emotional challenges around giving the baby back to their parents, but we don’t worry about it either. It’s a worry for other people.” It’s a testament to the motivation and character of many women who choose surrogacy, and to a thorough screening process. “It’s my theory that this is why we don’t see attachment issues. If we weren’t working with the right people I could see it coming up, but it doesn’t,” Lori says. As the relationship progresses and these concerns subside, most intended parents and surrogates are able to find a level of communication that is comfortable for everyone involved – even after baby arrives. Should you involve your child in the relationship? The level of involvement your surrogate has with your child in the future depends on what all parties feel comfortable with. In other words, the relationship looks different for each and every match. For Nicole’s intended parents, there was no question that she would be a fixture in their family. “I would like to make it a very important part of their story,” Samantha explained. “Always bring up Nicole, have a picture of her, not make this at all a secret.” Though it’s wonderful when intended parents make the decision to keep their surrogate so involved, the relationship can be equally fulfilling without regular contact. Many surrogates welcome and appreciate a photo and update from time to time, but they understand it is not a requirement. And while this is something that will be discussed throughout the surrogacy journey, the reality is that as time goes on, communication may drop off. Ultimately, the hope is that all parties will be able to look back on the surrogacy experience with appreciation for what it was and the incredible impact it made.

    "content": "Are you considering a repeat surrogacy journey? You’re not alone! Many women travel the path of surrogacy multiple times, for a variety of reasons. Just like your first surrogate pregnancy, you’ll want to consider multiple factors and make a decision that is best for you and your family. If a repeat surrogacy feels like it might be the right choice for you, we are here to support and help arm you with the knowledge you need to embark on the next chapter of your continuing journey. Am I crazy to want to do a repeat surrogacy journey? Not at all! Many women want to become a surrogate again. While some agencies might vary on their qualifications regarding repeat surrogacies, it is very common for gestational carriers to pursue multiple surrogacies. This makes a lot of sense, especially when you think about it from the perspective of your first surrogacy journey. The selflessness and dedication required of a surrogate are uniquely ingrained traits that surrogates may feel a continued calling to realize, and our surrogates often describe their experience as life changing and deeply fulfilling. Many of our surrogates point to these feelings as some of the driving forces for their journey, which aligns with their desire to want to repeat the experience. Will my family support my decision to become a repeat surrogate? Our repeat surrogates often speak directly to the overwhelming support of their families when it comes to their decision to do a repeat journey. That’s mirrored when we talk to their partners and families. They frequently tell us how proud they are of the strong women they support through multiple journeys. That said, every family has a different set of circumstances to consider, and it is your responsibility to have an open and honest conversation with your family about your decision. Having a strong support system, including your family and your tribe, is a crucial part of a successful surrogacy. Reflecting on and discussing how your lifestyle may have changed since your most recent surrogacy can be a good starting point, including things like how your own child(ren) have changed, lifestyle shifts like a new career or caring for a loved one, and changes to your health. Each of these are things you may want to talk about with your family as you determine the best path for you. One thing we can say for certain is that you will have a deeply rooted support system with your team at ConceiveAbilities and your surrogate sisters. Our team is here to support you every step of the way from your application to the birth of your surro-baby. You’ll also have the support, experiences, advice, and everything else that comes with an amazing group of women who have their own diverse experiences with surrogacy. Wherever you are in your journey, you will never be alone. Why do surrogates decide to do a repeat surrogacy? Sibling Journey Intended parents often want a “sibling” journey, and therefore another surrogacy, to bring another healthy baby into their family. Sometimes intended parents know that this is their goal from the git-go; other times, they realize later that they want another child to love. Since our Matching Matters process has a 97% first time match rate, it’s no surprise that our surrogates and intended parents frequently develop strong friendships. Our repeat surrogates are frequently overjoyed at the opportunity to continue to build the family they helped to start. Help Build Another Family Many of our repeat surrogates choose to do another journey even if it is not a sibling journey. Surrogates have an admirable sense of selflessness that lends itself to simply wanting to help more intended parents turn their dream of a family into a reality. Compensation Repeat surrogates earn higher compensation than first time surrogates. At ConceiveAbilities, the compensation for first time surrogates starts at $72,000, while our repeat surrogates will earn higher compensation. This depends on variables like your location, among other considerations. We will work with you to determine how your individual circumstances will impact your compensation. Will I qualify again? Whether you are a repeat or a first time surrogate, you will still need to meet our basic qualifications to become a surrogate. There is also a limit on your total number of deliveries. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) sets the guideline of no more than five previous vaginal deliveries, but it’s important to talk with your doctor and us about your previous pregnancies since situations can vary and impact this guideline. How long do I need to wait before reapplying? Typically, a fertility clinic will require that you wait three months after a vaginal delivery or six months after a C-section before applying to become a surrogate again. Different agencies may vary on their requirements for reapplying, and depending on their qualifications you may need to wait longer. Any reputable agency will always work closely with you and your doctor to make sure you are positioned for a successful, healthy surrogacy, even if it means waiting longer to begin your next journey. Does ConceiveAbilities accept women who have worked with other agencies? Absolutely. We love working with repeat surrogates, whether they started their first journey here at ConceiveAbilities or meet us further along in their path. Repeat surrogates are a truly special group of women. Their past journeys help them know what to expect, and their experience gives them the unique ability to help their intended parents feel even more secure in the process. We’re also grateful that our repeat surrogates love working with us! Surrogates who have worked with other agencies before often tell us how much they appreciate our level of support and community-building. They appreciate the security and confidence we provide with things like a dedicated Match Manager, licensed mental health professionals, a legal team well-versed in fertility law, and a tribe in the Surrogate Sisterhood to share the journey with. Your success is our success, and our experience and proven track record provides our surrogates peace of mind in knowing they are supported through every step of their journey. Whether you’re considering a second or a fourth surrogacy journey, you are among an elite group of women who are considering a repeat surrogacy. Our surrogates have genuinely positive experiences throughout their journeys, regardless of their reason. It’s important to honestly consider the decision you are making; if you and your family decide that your surrogacy journey is meant to continue, know that you will be supported every step of the way with ConceiveAbilities.",

    "content": "Even though it may often seem like all surrogates are married or partnered, this is definitely not the case. Although being in a committed relationship is indeed common, this is not a requirement to become a surrogate. You too can succeed and thrive as a single mom and surrogate, and you will not be alone! ConceiveAbilities works with many strong, capable, and determined women who also happen to be single. Are there additional surrogacy requirements to meet if I’m a single mom? Actually, most of the requirements are the same. You’ll need to have given birth to and be raising at least one of your own children, have a stellar medical history, demonstrate financial and overall stability, and pass a comprehensive mental health evaluation. You’ll undergo a home check too, just like your fellow prospective surrogates who are married. One requirement that takes on quite a bit more significance when you’re single, though, is your social support network. This is because partners are typically the primary providers of emotional and physical support to surrogates during pregnancy and after delivery. And it’s a fact that whether for a surrogacy or not, pregnancy can be both challenging and unpredictable. As a result, you’ll definitely want to have a support system in place, and ensure that you’ve considered all of the following: Do you have people in your life who support your decision to become a surrogate? Can you lean on them emotionally when needed, and can you also share your surrogacy hopes and successes with them? Who will care for your children when you need to travel, attend appointments, and participate in monthly support groups? Who will help you with any household and childcare needs during periods of bed rest? If you experience severe morning sickness? As you recover from childbirth? When your pregnancy becomes either exhausting or physically taxing? When you just simply need a break? Can you call upon specific friends or family members in an emergency, and can they reach you quickly? What are some of the biggest challenges of being a single mom during a surrogacy journey, and how can I meet them head-on? Everyone knows that being a single mom is probably already one of the hardest jobs around, right? On top of that, chances are good that you probably have work and/or school commitments, too. Add on a surrogate pregnancy and the appointments, emails, phone calls, emotions, physical symptoms, and new relationships that go with it, and it’s clear that you’ll need to become even more of an expert juggler than you already are! You will absolutely be very busy, and you may occasionally feel more stressed and less supported than you did before becoming a surrogate, since you don’t have a live-in partner to confide in and to lean on. This, of course, is where growing your support system comes into play. It will be critically important to get comfortable with asking for and accepting help from your loved ones. As they shoulder some responsibilities for you temporarily, you can focus elsewhere, even if it means scheduling some needed and well-deserved time for self-care and rest. Physical and emotional recovery after a surrogacy delivery can also be more challenging for single moms – especially if delivery brings unexpected surprises, like a medical complication or a first-time emergency C-section. Again, this seems to be related to having less adult support available at home. The best way to meet this particular challenge head-on is to prepare for a range of possibilities in advance. Have plenty of back-up support ready and “on call,” just in case you end up needing it. Then, if you do need extra support after delivery, definitely ask for it! Is there agency support for single moms who are surrogates? Absolutely! Your match manager and your support group leader are invaluable sources of support for you. They can act as sounding boards when you need someone to listen; they can help you to access resources in your community, if your support system is unable to provide all of the help that you need; and they can advocate for you as needed. ConceiveAbilities surrogates are also part of monthly support groups and an online sisterhood. These resources allow you to connect with hundreds of current and former surrogates throughout the country and in your local area. This is a great way to get to know other women who can truly relate to your more unique circumstances and challenges. You’ll find yourself receiving support from many other surrogates, regardless of whether they too are single moms. However, if you would specifically like to hear from other single moms, you’ll have the ability either to reach out on your own, or ask your match manager or support group leader for help in getting connected. What if I want to date during my surrogacy? This is an important question! Even if you suspect right now that you absolutely won’t want to date during a surrogacy journey, what if that special someone happens to enter your life at that exact time? Not dating during your surrogacy does make things simpler; however, dating is not completely prohibited. It’s just very important to make good choices when choosing dating partners. After all, remember that you either are or will be carrying some precious cargo! Your intended parents didn’t enter into a surrogacy arrangement agreeing to work with your new romantic partner, so you’ll want to feel sure that it’s a person who both you and they can trust and respect. And of course this person should be completely on-board with and supportive of your surrogacy. If a romantic relationship seems to be taking a more serious turn, and it’s clear that both of you want to be exclusive and perhaps have sex, always prioritize the surrogacy and inform your match manager first. It’s taken a lot of effort to become a surrogate, and you won’t want to do anything to jeopardize an upcoming embryo transfer, put yourself in an unsafe situation during the pregnancy, or lose the trust of your intended parents. Let your match manager know what’s going on in the relationship and where it seems to be heading. He or she will then guide you toward the next steps. Depending on the particular stage of the surrogacy process that you’re in at the time, your new significant other may need to participate in the legal process with you, or he/she may need to undergo psychological and/or medical testing just as married partners are required to do. Remember that any requests for your new partner’s participation in the process are put in place for everyone’s protection. As long as you follow clinic restrictions and any guidelines outlined in your legal contract, and also keep your match manager informed if you become involved in a relationship that starts to become more serious, you should be able to navigate surrogacy and dating at the same time. Do intended parents even want to get matched with single mom surrogates? Yes, ConceiveAbilities has successfully matched many surrogates who are single moms! Knowing that pregnancy will place additional demands on a surrogate, intended parents do want to be assured that their surrogates have access to good support. They may also have questions or initial concerns about what may happen if their surrogate gets involved with new romantic partners during the surrogacy. ConceiveAbilities staff will help ease their minds, assuring them that surrogates will follow the dating guidelines discussed above. If becoming a surrogate is your dream and you have good support around you, you can do this! Even though you may encounter some additional challenges, they won’t be insurmountable. In the meantime, you’ll be acting as a wonderful role model for your own children. And in the end, you’ll feel a unique and unmatched sense of accomplishment when you gift another family with their perfect baby boy or girl.",

    "content": "Surrogacy from the surrogate’s husband’s perspective When Scott’s wife Amanda let him know that she was considering surrogacy, he admits that he “didn’t really know it was a thing” to become a surrogate. Despite his initial lack of knowledge about the journey his wife was about to embark on, Scott had no hesitations about supporting Amanda (and their two biological children) throughout her pregnancy. In fact, their experience was so fulfilling that Amanda began her second surrogacy journey, with the same intended parents, less than a year after giving birth to her first surrobaby! From the outside, it can be easy to overlook the immense personal involvement that spouses or partners of surrogates take on when they commit to providing their support every step of the way. The saying “it takes a village” is usually used in the context of raising a child, but we believe the same is true when it comes to supporting our amazing surrogates. Scott, an instrumentation technician at a nuclear power plant by day, graciously spent some time to share his perspective on Amanda’s surrogacy journey. From how he became educated on what surrogacy really is to what he now sees as a positively life changing journey for his whole family, we are so glad to share his experience as a husband to a surrogate mother. Starting the journey ConceiveAbilities: What do you like to do for fun/hobbies? Scott: I like to golf, watch football, go to baseball games, travel, play games with the kids, [and] hang out with the family. ConceiveAbilities: How old are your two beautiful children now? Do you think your kids know how awesome their mom is? Scott: Kennedy just turned 10 last week and Reid is 8, he will be 9 in December. [And] I think they do, they both brag to their friends and classmates. Especially Kennedy, the first journey she went around telling everyone her mom was having a baby for someone else. They also both watched her go through all the shots and know how much work it took. ConceiveAbilities: When did you first hear about Amanda’s desire to become a surrogate? Scott: Shortly after we knew we were done having any more kids of our own, Amanda brought it up. I knew she enjoyed being pregnant, but we didn’t want any more kids of our own. ConceiveAbilities: What was your first thought when you heard the idea? Did you have any hesitations? Scott: When she first mentioned it, I didn’t really know it was a thing. […] At first I didn’t understand the process and how she wouldn’t be biologically related until she explained it. After that I was all good! The husband’s role in surrogacy ConceiveAbilities: Husbands/ partners are involved in the process more than most folks might assume. Can you provide a quick rundown of your direct involvement, specifically the psychological testing and medical workups (if you had to do this)? Scott: I remember Amanda and I sitting down with Alicia for the psychological part, all that went fine, it felt like a normal conversation. I didn’t need to go to the medical work up, just lab work locally. I helped Amanda by giving her her shots when needed and just supporting her however I could. ConceiveAbilities: Did you attend the embryo transfer with Amanda? If so, can you tell me a bit about that experience from your perspective? Scott: I went to the transfer with her for the first journey, her mom went with her the second journey. It happened really fast – it seemed like we waited in the clinic room for a long time, and then [the transfer] went really fast. It was cool to be able to see the embryos on the screen. ConceiveAbilities: How were Amanda’s surrogacy pregnancies different (for you) from her pregnancies with your own children? Scott: We didn’t have to prep our house for a baby, so we got to focus more on enjoying the pregnancy and hanging out with the guys. ConceiveAbilities: How were Amanda’s surrogacy pregnancies similar (for you) from her pregnancies with your own children? Scott: She didn’t get morning sickness [with either type of pregnancy] and handles the pregnancies pretty well. ConceiveAbilities: Did you become friends with your IPs? Around where in the process did that happen (if it did)? Scott: I would say we became friends. I would say this probably really happened when they came to Chicago a few weeks before the pregnancies and we got to spend a lot of time together […] We had a group chat with the four of us on WhatsApp. All four of us messaged quite often throughout the pregnancies. ConceiveAbilities: What was it like to watch your IPs become fathers? Scott: I think it was emotional in the delivery room, it reminded me of when I became a dad for the first time. I was happy for them. The lasting impact of surrogacy on family ConceiveAbilities: Are you proud of what your family (but mostly Amanda!) has done for your IPs? Scott: Yes, I’m very proud of Amanda. There are not many women who could do what she did. I’m also proud of my kids for treating Camila and Gaspar like siblings and welcoming the guys into our family. ConceiveAbilities: What effect have Amanda’s surrogacy journeys had on your family? Scott: We’ve gained a whole new family! We hope to always stay close to the guys and the kids. I think the surrogacy has opened my kids’ eyes to see that families come in all different forms and are created in all different ways. ConceiveAbilities: What do you wish people understood about surrogacy? Scott: It’s a cool journey to helping people complete their families. ConceiveAbilities: Any advice for men whose wives are considering surrogacy? Anything else you’d like to add? Scott: Support your wife. It really wasn’t a sacrifice for me, she did all the hard work. Thanks for giving my wife the opportunity of fulfilling her dream of being a surrogate! We can’t thank Scott enough for sharing his family’s story with us. ConceiveAbilities is proud to provide unparalleled support and resources to all of our surrogates and their families, and we are grateful for partners like Scott who mirror our commitment to our surrogates throughout their journeys.

    "content": "Since gestational surrogates submit to comprehensive application processes that include mental health evaluations for them and their partners, it’s only natural to wonder about similar acceptance requirements for prospective intended parents. What exactly are these guidelines and how are they determined? Read on to learn more about what may be required of you as an intended parent, and how these items are accomplished. Are there requirements to be an intended parent? Here at ConceiveAbilities, we believe that everyone deserves a family – regardless of your marital status, sexual orientation, age, race, religion, political beliefs, occupation, etc. That being said, we do need to know that your fertility clinic has cleared you to move forward with surrogacy. You will meet with your doctor prior to being matched with one of our surrogates so we can feel confident that your clinic will proceed with your match. While not necessarily a requirement, many clinics will want to know that you have a medical reason for pursuing surrogacy, and they will want you to demonstrate overall psychological stability, too. Is it possible to get rejected to be an intended parent? For the safety of our surrogates and to ensure that you will provide a safe environment for a child, we do run criminal background checks on all interested intended parents. Past convictions may preclude you from proceeding. While some clinics have age requirements for prospective intended parents, you shouldn’t necessarily assume that this rule applies to you. The upper limits of these requirements are typically quite high, since a.) older parents can still be very good parents, and b.) personal circumstances lead many individuals to pursue surrogacy later in life, rather than during the earlier and more traditional childbearing years. Ultimately, whether you are approved to move forward with a surrogacy match is typically determined by your fertility clinic. Do intended parents complete formal psychological evaluations? Although a formal psychological evaluation may or may not be conducted, your clinic will want to see evidence of psychological wellness, indicating that you will be able to handle the challenges of surrogacy. The majority of clinics have a mental health professional on staff who will discuss the emotional aspects of the surrogacy process with you – how to cope with a loss of control, how to communicate best with your surrogate, how to share your story and your plans with loved ones, how to support each other effectively as a couple, how to develop trust in your surrogate, and more. The primary goal is to ensure that you are educated and well informed about what to expect. After all, family building with a third party can be challenging, and it does present unique issues and stressors for intended parents. If your clinic has concerns about how your mental health may impact you or your surrogate during the upcoming process, they may ask you to request a formal clearance letter from a therapist prior to approving you for a surrogacy journey. Or, they may suggest or request that you attend counseling sessions to address mental health issues. How can you prepare for screening at your clinic? Realize that you are not alone. Though no two intended parents have the exact same history, many enter the world of surrogacy after years and years of infertility struggles, painful losses, and crushing disappointments. Others reach this point due to life-threatening complications during previous pregnancies, or due to life-altering medical diagnoses. These life experiences can and do have a dramatic and lasting impact on individuals, intimate relationships, and family systems. Consider how your experiences have shaped your current reality and molded your dreams for your future. Be open about what has led you to consider surrogacy, what you think you may need in a prospective surrogate, what concerns you, how you can access the support and coping skills you will need throughout your journey, and what your ultimate family-building goals look like. Bring your questions and your curiosity, too, and understand that it’s okay if you feel anxious or uncertain. For a quick refresher on important topics that may help you to prepare for your screening, review our article: What to Consider Before Entering into a Surrogacy Arrangement. Your willingness to be honest and transparent will assist both your clinic and ConceiveAbilities as we engage you in meaningful preparation for your role as intended parents. Can surrogates establish their own criteria to match with intended parents? When surrogates are being screened, we do ask them to consider with which types of intended parents they might prefer to be matched. Some surrogates prefer to match with international intended parents, for example. Others may prefer to work with a married couple, or with an intended parent who does not yet have children from a previous pregnancy or surrogacy. We ask surrogates to share their preferences so we can be more effective in ensuring an ideal match. After all, we know from experience that “matching matters!” It’s notable that many of our surrogates don’t actually have many requests or “requirements” for intended parents. When we screen our surrogates, it’s not uncommon to hear them say that they will work with anyone, because they just want to help someone to have a child. Surrogacy is beautiful, and it is a gift. However, it is also a long, complex, intimate, and emotional process for everyone involved. The more that surrogates and intended parents are thoroughly prepared and screened in advance, the greater the likelihood of a positive, successful arrangement and outcome for all. Do you have more questions about these early steps of becoming an intended parent? Contact us. We would be thrilled to talk you through the process and answer any questions that you may have as you start your surrogacy journey. Written By Lori Jurecko MA, LSW,ConceiveAbilities Match Manager",

    "content": "While in our hearts the gift of surrogacy is priceless, it can hit our savings account hard. It is wise to look for any possible avenues to save money on your path to parenthood – and to spend wisely – without sacrificing the quality needed to ensure the safety and health for all involved. Below, we’ll provide a general, high-level overview of surrogacy expenses, what may or may not be tax deductible, and explain what a Private Letter Ruling is. However, it’s important to note that tax laws vary from state to state on both a federal and state level. It’s vital to do your own research to ensure you get the best possible answer as it pertains to your own situation. When it comes to medical deductions you may need to exceed a certain limit, so again, it can vary. It’s also recommended that you consult with an accountant to learn more about taxation policies. I spoke to Edward “Brock” Brockschmidt, CPA Founder & CFO of Seed Trust, who has offered to help us out. What surrogacy expenses, if any, are tax-deductible? Brock: Surrogacy and donation expenses in general are not deductible. However, there are ways to make them deductible. The best way would be to obtain a Private Letter Ruling (PLR) from The Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The purpose of a PLR is to get permission from the IRS to deduct specific expenses that are not made clear by law. Can you walk us through the Private Letter Ruling (PLR) Process? Brock: The process would be as follows: Taxpayer (Parents) would engage with a CPA to write a letter to the IRS requesting permission to deduct the expenses. The letter should encompass all the expenses that they plan to incur. The CPA would most likely cite § 213(a) “A taxpayer may deduct expenses paid during the taxable year, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, for medical care of the taxpayer, spouse, or dependent, to the extent the expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income”. Section 213(d)(1)(A) provides that medical care includes amounts paid for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body. Rev. Rul. 73-201, 1973-1 C.B. 140, and Rev. Rul. 73-603, 1973-2 C.B. 76, hold that vasectomies and operations that render a woman incapable of having children affect a structure or function of the body and thus may qualify as medical care under § 213. The IRS would then send a letter back to the parents/CPA indicating their decision. Upon a successful decision the parents would attach that letter to their tax return. What about egg donor as a tax deduction? Brock: In previous PLR’s, the IRS has sided with parents to make all surrogacy and egg donation expenses allowable. However, the problem with PLR’s is that they cannot be cited for future use in other cases. Given the past requests and their successes, I would believe that the parents would have a great chance of success in pursuing the deduction. The great news is that once the private ruling has been awarded in favor of the parents, the entire process including the surrogacy agency fees could be deductible. What goes into a PLR Ruling? There are important factors that go into the PLR ruling. First, is that there is a tested infertility that has been confirmed to the taxpayer. The past PLRs have been related to heterosexual couples. Homosexual couples could have issues providing evidence they are infertile if none of the partners are infertile. There must be a medical need to pursue the deduction. While that may seem unfair, that is the IRS language around it. That doesn’t mean it will be turned down. There is just no evidence of successful past letters that I could find. Second, this needs to be done well in advance of completing the journey. The process takes a long time. Sixty to ninety days is the standard, but it could take up to six months in complicated cases. What are some general deductible costs? Brock: Costs that are deductible are ones that are directly attributable to the parents. For example, any doctor visit that the parents are personally being examined would be deductible. Doctor’s appointments for the surrogate or egg donor would not be deductible. The same would go for medical testing. There could be an argument made without a ruling that legal, agency and escrow fees are deductible as they directly involve the parents as one of the parties. However, I would be much more comfortable with a PLR before putting that on a tax return. They must be directly tied to a medical expense where the IRS could claim that they don’t recognize surrogacy and egg donation as a medical expense. What Can Be Deducted: Any medical expenses directly attributed to you and your spouse Egg retrieval Sperm donation Sperm freezing IVF costs What Cannot Be Deducted: Surrogate compensation Surrogate medical bills Surrogate medical insurance Anything not directly related to your family To learn more about your specific state, surrogacy and how ConceiveAbilities can support you every step of the way, please contact us. While this process can be overwhelming, we have a team of people who have been a surrogate, worked with a surrogate to build their family or have had years helping others build their families.

    "content": "We recently had the opportunity to sit down with Andrea Syrtash. Andrea Syrtash is a relationship and lifestyle expert, TV personality and published author who, inspired by her own infertility journey, founded pregnantish. The site is an online platform for others experiencing fertility challenges. Since then, she’s shared her fertility ups and downs and how she has gone on to expand her family through surrogacy. Below, she answers our questions and offers her insight on making the transition to pursue using a gestational carrier, becoming an intended parent and finding a gestational carrier that works best for your situation. ConceiveAbilities: Can you briefly walk us through your infertility journey and what led you to pursue surrogacy? Andrea: The brief(ish) version: it took me almost 10 years to meet my now 10-month-old baby! For the first six years of trying and fertility treatments, we didn’t realize that my body was likely rejecting some healthy embryos. Between 2011-2018, I did approximately 18 treatments (IUI and IVF procedures) and had open-stomach surgery in 2012 to remove a massively large fibroid tumor. In 2013, I learned that the baby I miscarried was ‘healthy’ after I had a D&C. I lost that pregnancy at around 9 weeks, after we had seen a heartbeat, and I was devastated. The following year I lost another pregnancy after our embryo had implanted following IVF. In 2016/2017, a reproductive endocrinologist (RE) told me that after so many years trying and so many treatments, something should’ve worked. I made a Day 5 blastocyst embryos that he said looked good, and this doctor encouraged me to genetically test the next ones before transferring anything else into my body Once we had healthy embryos from testing, he encouraged me to consider working with a gestational surrogate, whereby we’d use our embryo and implant it into a gestational carrier. He said that that would be our best shot at meeting our baby. He was right! My first cousin delivered our little girl, who had been frozen in 2016, in December 2018. ConceiveAbilities: Can you describe the feeling of “accepting” that you needed the help of a surrogate to build your family? Andrea: I think one thing people don’t realize is that by the time many people arrive at surrogacy as intended parents, they’ve been through the ringer trying to get or stay pregnant. Nobody ‘just’ gets a surrogate to work with. By the time we moved to this point I was excited and a bit heartbroken, too. This wasn’t the way I imagined meeting our baby and I was nervous. Surrogacy has so many elements that have to come together and I felt overwhelmed by it all. I also felt relieved that maybe we had a new option to consider. If my doctor was right though, this would get us closer to our dream of meeting our baby. ConceiveAbilities: In your journey, you had two carriers drop out before your cousin offering to be a surrogate for you. What would you say to intended parents who are starting this journey in terms of finding “the right carrier” and going through that process? Andrea: It’s imperative to trust the agency you work with and to understand that every process that involves humans involves emotions. I was more understanding when the first GC changed her mind. The second woman who left us left me speechless. We had formed a relationship with her over several months and had covered all the necessary counseling, medical tests and legal steps to ensure we were all entering a good arrangement. We said yes to everything she requested in the legal contract. Still, we didn’t really know her. She had a whole life behind the scenes and was struggling financially. The agency we used shouldn’t have worked with her, knowing this. I would tell other IPs: Research the agency you work with (if you work with one) and ask about the screening they do to ensure the surrogates they work with are financially stable and that they are committed. Speak to the surrogate and trust your gut. Keep communication open with the surrogate you are working with, so she realizes you’re there for her if she needs anything. I think people who act as surrogates are incredible and most are in it for the ‘right reason’ – they want to help others bring a child into the world and some even enjoy being pregnant. I’ve always been grateful to surrogates who help people like me, who have medical issues in my body that prevent me from carrying a pregnancy to term. But like any relationship, trust is the foundation and you can’t move forward with someone if you don’t trust the agency or the woman. So – trust your gut feeling here and the evidence that everyone is on the same page! ConceiveAbilities: Once the process began and a pregnancy was achieved (yaaaay!), how was it to have someone carry your child? Relief? Nervousness? Excitement? All the above? Andrea: I was incredibly lucky that my first cousin Elana offered to be our gestational carrier. She and I have always been connected and I trust her deeply. I was relieved that she would carry our embryo. I knew that if the healthy embryo was in my body, I likely would’ve lost her. That was a much more nerve-wracking thought than the idea of Elana carrying for me! I think nervousness during this process is normal, too. This is literally LIFE – the most important thing! You wouldn’t be normal if you didn’t feel the high stakes during every step. ConceiveAbilities: Now that you’re on “the other side” and have become a parent through surrogacy after years of infertility treatment, what advice would you give to those pursuing using a gestational carrier? Andrea: Funny, I am and I’m not on the ‘other side’ since I’m still infertile and we have another healthy embryo frozen and have no idea how we would meet her if we want to try to give Arielle a sibling. My cousin was amazing but won’t be our GC again, as she is still building her family. So, I’d have to start again and the thought is overwhelming (and expensive). But, I’m on the other side in that I have a healthy beautiful strong daughter who makes me pinch myself daily. I dreamed of having her (well, a baby) for so many years.I would tell people that working with a GC you trust is an incredible thing. There will be bumps in the road, just like we all get used to during infertility and/or fertility treatments, but the destination is so beautiful. ConceiveAbilities: Lastly, you’ve taken your journey and made it bigger than yourself and created pregnantish to help others to not only share your story but share other family building options (IUI, IVF, adoption, third-party reproduction such as egg donation, embryo donation, etc.) What do you hope people gain from the overall message of pregnantish and your work? Andrea: I hope people know that there are so many ways families are built today. Some of us need sperm, eggs or embryos from someone else in order to family-build and others, like me, needed a healthy uterus to bring my baby into the world. Those who pursue adoption, fostering or living child-free also deserve for their version of family to be reflected. The narrative ‘first comes love, then marriage, then baby carriage’ is outdated for millions of people today. The point of pregnantish is to tell the new baby story. We include singles and LGBT on our site, in addition to hetero couples. Too often infertility is framed as a rich white older woman’s issue. We just did a nationwide survey of 1100 people and the average age of the survey respondent, who was navigating infertility, was 33. We feature powerful non-white voices and male voices and trans voices on pregnantish. We tell the story of modern family with great content on pregnantish. It’s important for me to say: pregnantish isn’t a blog and it’s not about me! We’ve published over 50 writers from diverse backgrounds. I often say that pregnatish is sci-fi meets Hallmark! Funny, I think “Modern Family” is a cute TV show, but it’s not even that modern anymore! My goal is to make our content reflect the story of today’s modern family. Every week we publish deeply personal essays by people who are building or built their families ‘with help’. My goal is to support people building their families with help and to elevate the conversation of how so many of us become parents today. Infertility can be so damn isolating. Finally, I’ve worked in the media for years as an author and on-air personality and I’m trying to leverage my existing platform to show more people that infertility is a disease and that everyone who works so hard to be a parent deserves that opportunity.

    "content": "A common question from gestational carrier applicants is whether it’s possible to continue a full time job during a surrogacy journey. Considering the logistics and emotional commitment involved, some wonder if it’s realistic to maintain your normal, day-to-day responsibilities. Can you really fit becoming a surrogate mother into your family, work and daily life routines? Together with the perspective from our very own Ashtin Gurevitz, we take a closer look at the expectations of a surrogate, as well as the realities of working both in and outside the home while pregnant. Is it possible to keep working while pregnant? Absolutely. In fact, the majority of surrogates who work outside the home continue at their jobs throughout the pregnancy and well into their third trimester, just as they may have done with their own children. If you have a full time job and are wondering if you can fit surrogacy into your life, we can assure you that is indeed how it is often done. Pros of working full time while pregnant There can be many positive aspects of working during a surrogate pregnancy. Career fulfillment. If you love what you do, working toward your professional goals can provide a sense of fulfillment outside of being a gestational carrier. Keeping an identity outside of your role as a surrogate mother may be an emotional need your job helps you to maintain. Employer Benefits. You can continue to utilize any benefits your employer offers. If you are lucky enough to have extra perks like a gym membership or dental coverage, it’s nice to have the option to take advantage of those in addition to medical benefits. Camaraderie. Your colleagues can provide an additional layer of support throughout your pregnancy. At minimum, this could mean that there are always extra drivers around if you have a doctor’s appointment over lunch and a dead car battery. At its best, you may connect with a wonderful group of people who are available eight hours a day to lend a supportive ear or join you for a walking lap around the office. Cons of working full time while pregnant While it’s still very doable, working while pregnant can present challenges as well. Managing side effects. Handling the physical effects of pregnancy while working full time can take some additional planning and preparation. The act of helping others build a family is beautiful and yet sometimes, early in the pregnancy, there is morning sickness and exhaustion that can come along with it. Later in the pregnancy, there may be limitations on your physical agility for jobs that require you to be on your feet all day. Time management. You are responsible for attending scheduled appointments throughout your pregnancy, and some may fall within typical work hours. Consider the flexibility of your schedule and job responsibilities. Despite any challenges, you are not the first to follow the path of working full time as a surrogate. There is a wealth of resources and guidance from women and professionals who have learned firsthand from their experience working while pregnant. Surrogacy for stay at home moms Perhaps you are looking for ways to continue to stay home with your own children while earning income. There are plenty of stay at home moms who decide to become surrogates. Whether a surrogate works out of the home or in, many find the camaraderie with others to be one of the highlights of the journey. As a ConceiveAbilities surrogate, you join a community of women who are there to encourage and support one another, often sharing tips for working full time during surrogacy. To be clear, surrogacy is not a job. It is a calling which compensates and it is prudent to consider the ways in which surrogacy is different than a regular salary. Steady compensation. Significant payments may not begin until the first or second confirmation of the baby’s heartbeat. Although it is rare, matches can sometimes face challenges in reaching that particular milestone. If your match experiences delays, your compensation may also be delayed. Health insurance. It may be crucial to maintain your employment status throughout your journey as a surrogate to avoid disruptions in your primary health insurance, if your health insurance is provided by your employer. Advice on working while pregnant 1. Know your rights. Working with a reputable surrogacy agency like ConceiveAbilities gives you access to an in house legal team to help your understand your rights and what laws are applicable to you. State laws and employer policies vary, but it is generally illegal for employers to discriminate based on pregnancy or related conditions. This is just one example of your rights as a surrogate, and working with our legal team along with your own attorney will help you understand the full scope of your rights related to your employment while pregnant. 2. Talk to management. It’s highly encouraged to tell your boss or HR about your pregnancy before other coworkers. First, this will give your boss more context to better assist if you need additional accommodations during work. Second, your boss’s knowledge may help limit the news traveling until you choose to share it with your other coworkers. Third, being up front with your boss opens communication to game plan for any pregnancy-related situations that may arise. 3. Prepare for common side effects. Taking a proactive approach to managing these effects during work can be beneficial. Nausea: Avoid foods and situations that you know trigger queasiness. If your stomach starts flipping when your coworker insists on reheating fish in the microwave, try taking a quick walk outside during their lunch break. You can also keep a stash of stomach-settling foods in your workspace as a quick fix when you feel nauseous. Saltines, ginger ale and ginger candy can help course correct an unexpected wave of morning sickness. Fatigue: Incorporating short, frequent breaks or walks into your workday can help reboot energy if you are feeling fatigued. Adding more protein to your diet can also help reduce fatigue. Try keeping some high protein snacks on hand, or incorporate a big leafy salad at lunch. Drinking plenty of fluids is important whether or not you are pregnant and staying hydrated can help combat fatigue. Even if it’s the last thing you want to do at the end of the day, sticking to your exercise routine also has its benefits: it boosts mental and physical energy levels, as does focusing on getting a full night’s sleep as often as you can. Discomfort: Make small changes to reduce physical discomfort throughout the day. Do you need to bring a pillow to work for better back support while you are sitting? Do you have a comfortable pair of shoes with good arch support for long periods of standing? Small considerations like these can have a big impact. Stay healthy mentally as well. Try implementing mini-meditations throughout the day, or seeking out the support of a friend or trusted coworker for vexing problems. Do surrogacy agencies advise surrogate mothers to work full time? At ConceiveAbilities, we are focused on a healthy pregnancy for the surrogate and the baby. We encourage gestational carriers to continue with their normal lives, while always following doctor’s orders. Using the resources of a surrogacy agency will set you up for success to navigate working full time as a gestational carrier. At ConceiveAbilities, we take the extra step to make sure that your compensation as a surrogate takes into account what you earn, so that if you have any time periods with lost wages, you are fully made whole. Learn more about how that works for you with our personalized surrogacy pay calculator. Further, we will help you understand your rights and guide you to helpful resources. For instance, we partner with top health professionals who can provide guidance if any element of your work environment is not conducive to a healthy pregnancy. We also take your employment into account during the matching process. Any intent to change your employment status should be shared with your team as early as possible. We will make sure that you are matched with intended parents who understand and value your preferences about being employed full-time, or not, while pregnant. We get it. Your life is busy. Allow us to assure you that this is a role unlike any other. Are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate? Learn more about the process of helping someone else’s dream of building a family come true. We would love to talk with you.",

    "content": "If you’re considering donating your eggs, congratulations! It is truly one of the greatest gifts one can give to another. As egg donation becomes a more mainstream option for building a family, more and more Asian couples are seeking an Asian egg donor. If you are a woman of Chinese, Japanese or Korean descent, read on to learn more about why and how to become an egg donor, plus what you need to know about egg donor compensation. This unique process is one that benefits everyone involved. The importance of diversity in egg donation We believe that egg donor diversity is about empowering intended parents with choice. Asian egg donors, for example, are in great demand. Cultural attitudes, in addition to many other factors, place a high priority on donors with Chinese, Japanese and Korean descent. Other backgrounds, including East Indian/Asian egg donors and Jewish egg donors are also consistently sought out by intended parents. It’s understandable that someone would want to select an egg donor who feels and looks like family, and who possess characteristics that make their ethnicity so unique. Egg donation can be challenging enough for an intended parent mourning the use of their own DNA, so a donor of the same ethnic background is often non-negotiable. In order to meet this need, we keep our donor database as diverse as possible. Due to the scarcity of available eggs, whether it’s within certain areas of the world or within certain ethnic lines, the need is great. Whether she is an East Indian, Jewish or Asian egg donor, these backgrounds that are more difficult to find often receive a higher level of compensation What’s the average compensation for an Asian egg donor? The short answer: it depends. While the base pay for ConceiveAbilities donors is $8000 (above the industry norm) Asian donors are in extremely high demand. Because factors like ethnicity, location and the number of previous cycles impact egg donor pay, it’s likely that someone who meets one or more of those criteria will receive higher compensation. Asian donors typically receive upwards of $10,000 per cycle. Donor compensation will be discussed in much greater detail during your initial consultation with our team, so you will have a clearer idea of what you can expect your egg donor pay to be. What are the requirements to become an egg donor? There are a number of requirements to become an egg donor, ranging from medical to physical to mental health aspects. In order to be considered a suitable donor candidate, you must meet the following criteria. You are of prime childbearing age. As it specifically relates to egg donation, you must be between the ages of 21-28 years old. If a candidate is outside of this range, she is more likely to have poor quality, or aneuploidy, eggs. This means the eggs have an abnormal number of cells and cannot develop into viable embryos. You don’t smoke. This includes nicotine, vaping, and general drug use. You are physically healthy. This includes a BMI under 28, regular monthly menstrual cycles, and no reproductive disorders or abnormalities. Your birth control method matters. Donor candidates cannot currently be on the Depo-Provera shot or have an Implanon/Nexplanon arm implant. Not only can these hormones impact your cycle, they can impact the way your body responds to fertility medication. You are committed to the process. This means being willing to undergo medical and psychological evaluations, as well as commit to the program for a minimum of 6 months and willingness to respond to all correspondence within 24 hours. The value of donating your eggs The reasons for becoming an egg donor are, of course, personal and vary from woman to woman. The financial benefit is a major incentive, with some donors using their egg donor compensation to help pay off student loans, to travel or to start a business venture. While the financial reward is enticing, it’s rarely the thing that motivates someone to go through with egg donation. Most donors find that there is something deeply gratifying about helping another person in such a profound way. Cara, who donated five times, found a surprising sense of purpose in the process. “During and after the first match is when it really hits you that the intended parents on the other end are depending on you so much,” she explains. “The feeling of responsibility and benevolence was compounded after having experienced one donation, making my decision to donate again an easy one.” How can you become an egg donor? First, you’ll want to do your due diligence. That means research – everything from the requirements to the procedure itself to a reputable agency to work with. Egg donation is not a solo venture; you’ll want a team of professionals to help guide you through the nuances of the process. Here at ConceiveAbilities, we make that as straightforward as possible. First, you’ll want to complete an online registration to become an egg donor. If your application is accepted, we’ll invite you to an intake interview. This is to discuss the process in more detail, but primarily to answer questions and to make sure egg donation is the right fit for you and your current lifestyle. Next is matching; while the length of time it takes to make a match is variable, once you are matched with intended parents you can expect an average of about 3 months until the egg retrieval. Throughout the process, you can expect one-to-one support and education, legal guidance and, of course, the security of working with industry pioneers. If you’re an Asian egg donor ready to take the first steps on this rewarding journey, we are here to support and look forward to meeting you!",

    "content": "Can you use a surrogate if you are physically able to conceive? The answer is unequivocally yes. The fact is that the decision to pursue surrogacy is a multi-faceted; it takes into account much more than just an intended parent’s ability to carry a baby. Medical issues, including infertility, play a major role. However, the financial, emotional, and personal lifestyle components of surrogacy are important to consider. Infertility is not the only reason intended parents may choose to use a surrogate, nor is it a requirement to embark on the path of building a family through surrogacy. At ConceiveAbilities, we advocate for equality in making this decision, and we welcome women who may be able to carry but choose not to. What is “social surrogacy”? Historically, the inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to term have been the primary circumstances for intended parents choosing surrogacy. Considering our modern culture, this scope is limited. ConceiveAbilities’ mission is to help women and couples with fertility issues, global couples navigating geopolitical issues, and same-sex couples or singles who are unable to – or choose not to – carry a baby. There are many reasons that a woman may not want to carry a child, and there is an increasing number of women who are able to conceive that choose surrogacy – sometimes referred to as “social surrogacy.” Whatever your reason for deciding on surrogacy, you will be supported through every step of the way with leading experts and a compassionate and customized approach to your journey. Why choose surrogacy? Surrogacy is a deeply personal journey. There may be trends and similarities amongst intended parents who opt to use a surrogate, but no two reasons for choosing to use surrogacy are the same. Traditional reasons to use surrogacy Health and medical considerations have traditionally been the impetus for intended parents turning to surrogacy. Some of these include: Infertility Age Same-sex couples wanting to create a family using an egg donor and services of a gestational carrier Uterine scarring or other uterine structural defects which would inhibit the ability to safely carry a baby to full term Existing medical conditions that may make pregnancy dangerous for the mother and baby, including a history of breast cancer, preeclampsia, heart disease and diabetes Complicated past pregnancies and/or history of miscarriage Non-medical reasons to use surrogacy With the rise in popularity of surrogacy, especially in the last decade, more thought has been given to the idea that surrogacy should be available to intended parents who are able to conceive but choose not to. While the decision to use a surrogate is personal, a career in the spotlight is one example of opting for surrogacy as a social choice. Other examples include: AthletesLifestyles which place a high focus on athleticism are often incredibly physically demanding. Whether you are a professional athlete or someone who craves their twice daily cross fit class, this level of exertion may not lend itself to an ideal physical environment to carry a baby. Maintaining this lifestyle is an active choice with an option for surrogacy. Risky Careers or HobbiesA dream career may not align with a safe pregnancy. If you have put years of work into becoming a pilot, sommelier, beekeeper, or construction supervisor, for example, it may feel like an internal battle between your passion for your work and your desire to grow your family. A chosen career path that may present safety and health risks to the pregnancy means an option for surrogacy, even if a woman is able to conceive on her own. Whatever factors come into play, the common thread – creating a family – is what matters most. ConceiveAbilities firmly believes in the right of all intended parents to build their families in a way that aligns with their personal choices and lifestyles. Are there requirements for intended parents to use surrogacy? Personal RequirementsThere is no extensive list of requirements for an intended parent to use a surrogate, but it’s important to consider the implications of the financial and emotional investment you are making in your family. Surrogacy is a marathon, not a sprint, and willingness to navigate the road ahead is a vital prerequisite. ConceiveAbilities screens their applicants, but not through a list of checkboxes. We conduct a background check and most of our clients meet with a psychologist through their fertility clinic to discuss the emotional dynamics of surrogacy. The surrogacy process begins with a consultation. We have designed our process to help you through every step of the way, and what that looks like will be different for every intended parent. Your initial consultation will help us learn more about your unique goals and motivations, and will give you all the information you need to know about the steps of surrogacy. We also believe that Matching Matters and have developed a proprietary process to ensure we find the surrogate that is a perfect match for you. Here, we learn everything from your communication style to your expectations after the baby is born to make sure we connect you to a surrogate with whom you’ll be most compatible. Legal RequirementsSurrogacy is not legal everywhere, and the nuances of laws where surrogacy is legal can vary by state. Typically, the state laws where the baby is born determine which laws apply to parentage. You will have the expertise of a team to ensure that your needs and goals align with the specific legalities of your surrogate’s location. Medical RequirementsConceiveAbilities is a gestational surrogacy agency, meaning that the surrogate is not genetically related to the baby she carries. The embryo is created using the intended parents’ sperm and egg or donor sperm and/or egg. The health of the gestational carrier and the baby are top priority in a surrogacy arrangement, so all donors undergo medical screening when the embryos are created to ensure that any genetic factors or family history are accounted for. Since the intended parents may or may not be the donors in gestational surrogacy, the requirement of medical records for intended parents can vary by state, agency, or unique circumstances within each surrogacy arrangement. Your partner in family building Making the choice to use a surrogate is a different conversation for all intended parents. It may feel like the clear choice for those who have been battling infertility, while others may be unsure of their options if they are able to conceive but choose not to. Regardless of what led you to choose surrogacy, ConceiveAbilities is committed to a safe, secure, and customized approach to every intended parent who is ready to build their family.",

    "content": "Everything An Intended Parent Needs to Know about the Mock Cycles If you are in the early stages of medical screening with your surrogate, or if you’re engaged in any online surrogacy research or chat groups, you have probably heard the term “mock cycle.” Since requirements for the mock cycle vary across fertility clinics and individual surrogates, you may have some lingering questions about this topic. Read on for some helpful information about what to expect. (Learn more about the entire surrogacy process on our website.) What is a mock cycle? First, let’s define this process. Simply put, a mock cycle is a trial run of medications for your surrogate, typically occurring prior to her medical clearance. This is different from the medication cycle that precedes an embryo transfer, because it does not lead to an embryo transfer at the end. Instead, it’s a preparatory step that is ordered for your surrogate by the fertility doctor to help gauge your surrogates response. Mock cycles can and do look different and last for varying lengths of time (anywhere from a few weeks to one month), depending on the doctor who is ordering them. In every case, though, surrogates will take some or all of the same hormonal medications that they will also take during the actual embryo transfer cycle. Bodily responses to the mock cycle medications are monitored throughout the cycle as well. Ultrasounds measure how the medications are impacting the uterine lining, while lab work measures the surrogate’s hormone levels. Once the medications have achieved the desired results, the mock cycle ends, and your surrogate is considered ready to move forward with an embryo transfer. How is a mock cycle beneficial? Since your surrogate takes the same medications she will eventually take for the embryo transfer, the mock cycle helps to ensure that her body will respond appropriately to the medications when it’s “go” time. Is her uterine lining thickening appropriately and at the desired or expected rate? Are her hormone levels changing appropriately? Do dosages of certain medications need to be adjusted? Being able to answer these questions with hard data (i.e., ultrasound and lab results) gives your doctor the opportunity to individualize your surrogate’s later treatment plan. It can also help everyone (including you) to feel more confident that the process is likely to go smoothly during the “real” cycle, hopefully resulting in a pregnancy! Will my surrogate definitely need a mock cycle? Not necessarily. Many clinics evaluate the surrogate’s uterine lining during the medical work-up, at a specific point during her menstrual cycle. If her lining is appropriately thick at that time, your doctor may determine that a mock cycle is not necessary for her. Her body may already be showing signs of being able to achieve the changes that are needed to support a pregnancy, which is great news! If your surrogate does require a mock cycle, however, remember that it is simply a helpful tool for your doctor. Rest assured, most surrogates do “pass” the mock cycle and go onto the embryo transfer stage. Are there additional costs for the mock cycle? Unless your fertility clinic requires a mock cycle for every surrogate and factors those expenses into your overall fees, definitely expect to pay extra for this process. Your surrogate will be completing medical appointments and also taking extra medications, so there will be additional charges. The total cost will vary depending on your clinic’s protocol for the mock cycle (types of medications ordered; length of the cycle; number of monitoring appointments; etc). Regardless, though, if the mock cycle ultimately leads to a successful embryo transfer cycle, you may still have saved money in the long run. Will my surrogate’s health insurance cover the mock cycle costs? Insurance coverage for surrogacy medical expenses generally takes effect once your surrogate is released to her OB for regular prenatal care. Any fertility-related treatments (like the mock cycle) that take place prior to that point are typically not covered by insurance. Learn more about insurance and surrogacy by reading the below articles. –5 questions to ask when you’re considering infertility treatment–Health Insurance FAQs – What You Need to Know–Modern Infertility Insurance Blog Post Once you are moving toward medical clearance for your surrogate, your ConceiveAbilities Match Manager will make sure that you are fully informed about your surrogate’s next steps and your clinic’s plan for her care, whether that plan includes a mock cycle or not. Together, you will then all move forward toward the ultimate goal of building your family successfully!

    "content": "What if I say the wrong thing? What if I ask a silly question? What do I wear? What if they don’t like me? These are the kinds of questions you may find yourself worrying about before an interview – it’s understandable. But if you’re building your family with the help of a surrogate, you may be surprised to realize you’re stressed about the exact same things going into your surrogacy match meeting. The good news? You don’t have to feel anxious. Here’s how to prepare for your surrogacy match meeting so that you can go in feeling like yourself – which is exactly what you should be. What exactly is a match meeting? If you’re new to surrogacy, you might not be familiar with what a match meeting is – besides, that is, another item on the list of tasks to complete and one more thing to feel nervous about. Fortunately, a match meeting is relatively straightforward; it is the opportunity to meet, either in person or virtually, your possible surrogate match and her partner, if applicable. It’s your chance to ask and answer questions about your hopes and preferences for the surrogacy journey. So while it may seem a little like an interview at the surface level, it’s more of an opportunity to see if you’re compatible – a good match. And you won’t be on your own; at ConceiveAbilities, a member of our Matching Matters team will be present to help facilitate the meeting and answer any questions that may need further clarification. Once you’ve spoken with the potential surrogate, you’ll want to regroup and decide if she’s the one. If so, congratulations! You’ve just made one of the biggest decisions in your surrogacy journey and it’s time to move on to the next step. But we’re getting a little ahead of ourselves; let’s explore a bit more about how to prepare and what to expect during your match meeting. Questions the agency might ask you Believe it or not, a great deal of work goes into your potential match long before the meeting. Our proprietary matching process is designed to consider the most important factors of your match with a surrogate. We refer to this as Matching Matters®, which ultimately results in a 97% success rate on first meeting. It matches based on personality, legalities, reproductive choices, medical criteria and other specifics requested by the intended parents and the surrogate. It also takes into account aspects of the surrogacy process, including the intensive medical and psychological screening, to thoroughly vet compatibility. The result? The right match the first time, which ultimately saves you precious time and money. As you prepare for your match meeting with a potential surrogate, you’ll first meet with a surrogate match expert. This is an opportunity to share a real life depiction of who you are. You will be asked about your family and the family you’re hoping to create, as well as some thought-provoking questions around potential medical issues and legal preferences. There will also be more sensitive questions about things like selective reduction and termination. These are questions you’ll want to read through before your meeting, and it’s important to have an honest discussion with your partner and surrogate match expert. The clearer you can be before your match is made, the smoother the journey will be. How to prepare questions for your surrogate mother Another aspect of preparing for your surrogate match meeting is considering the qualities of your ideal match. After all, you’ll be in each other’s lives for at least a year! At ConceiveAbilities, we encourage you to think about our four main points of criteria; this includes psychological aspects, legal considerations, values and personal preferences. Your match expert will offer suggestions about which items should be non-negotiable and which might warrant a bit more flexibility. Doing this work during your Matching Matters consult will help you prepare the appropriate questions for your surrogate. Potential questions the surrogate mother could ask will likely be similar to yours. She’ll want to know a little more about you and perhaps why you are choosing surrogacy to build your family. She may ask about your expectations of her, and your hopes for communication during the process. The importance of discussing communication channels You’ve probably noticed that communication is a common theme in a surrogacy match. As Nazca Fontes, the Founder and CEO, puts it, “We create matches that work across all dimensions of the surrogacy journey – from lifestyle, to health, to communication style. Our attention to detail and experience makes all the difference.” Knowing that our Matching Matters® protocol takes these crucial points into account makes your match meeting as straightforward as possible. Better yet, it lays the foundation for shared expectations and strong communication throughout. Do you prefer regular communication through emails and text? Maybe, or perhaps contact around pivotal appointments and dates are best for you and your surrogate. Every match is different, and our goal is to respect and uphold these unique needs. Remember, you’ll also have a dedicated match manager working closely with you and your surrogate to ensure everyone stays on the same page. What questions should you ask your match manager? Start with a breakdown of the timeline. While the process is sometimes unpredictable, it helps immensely to have a good idea of what the general time frame looks like. Understanding the expectations during each step will help you move forward with confidence. Remember, you and your surrogate have a whole team of people who are there to support you and answer questions every step of the way. If you’re ready to find the right surrogate to help build your family, contact our team for more information.",

    "content": "Interview with Dr. Serena Chen for PCOS Awareness Month September is PCOS Awareness Month. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is the most common ovulatory disorder but is often either misdiagnosed or there is a tremendous delay in a proper diagnosis. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, affecting roughly one in ten women and girls, is a genetic, hormone, metabolic and reproductive disorder that affects women and girls. It is the leading cause of female infertility and if not treated properly, can cause other serious conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and endometrial cancer. PCOS Awareness Month is a federally designated event created to increase awareness of this condition to help both patients better advocate for themselves and educate medical professionals on how to recognize PCOS and properly diagnose and treat it. The ultimate goal is to improve the lives of those affected by PCOS, help them to overcome their symptoms, and prevent or reduce their risks for other potential life-threatening illnesses. In light of these goals, ConceiveAbilities spoke to Dr. Serena Chen. Dr. Chen serves as Director for the Division of Reproductive Medicine in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Saint Barnabas Medical Center, and the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at Saint Barnabas, and is a Clinical Associate Professor at Rutgers, UMDNJ Medical School and Saint George’s University School of Medicine. She loves empowering her patients with information and ideas about their mental and physical health in an interesting, accessible and practical way. She feels privileged to be at a program that is a leader in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), IUI, IVF, Single Embryo Transfer, LGBT family building, surrogacy, and PGT (Preimplantation Genetic Testing), offering individualized counseling, advice and treatment for a wide spectrum of reproductive issues. She strongly supports her patients’ right to be informed and involved in their treatment decisions and is an advocate of access to reproductive care for all. We were happy to help further her message with this interview. ConceiveAbilities: First, there are several statements I hear about PCOS that I was hoping you can clear up. They are mostly around weight and PCOS. It’s either that if you lose weight, you can get rid of PCOS or that PCOS only affects overweight women. Can you address that? Dr. Chen: It’s a lot more complicated than that. Polycystic ovary syndrome on the surface may seem like it’s exclusively just deals with ovaries, but it has to do with insulin resistance as well. The majority of people with PCOS have insulin resistance or high insulin. So having a higher level of insulin resistance can affect your metabolism and does make it easier to gain weight and harder to lose weight. Still, you can be on the leaner side or on the heavier side and still have an insulin resistance issue, so you can’t base the diagnosis just on weight. Having said that, when it comes to weight, there are other things that can affect your metabolism. No matter where you are on the scale, it is helpful to do strength training or cardio as you’re burning excess calories and building muscle mass. Especially if you have PCOS, I always recommend hiring a motivating personal trainer (anything to keep you motivated and engaged!) to work on building that muscle mass. Even with a genetic condition that won’t shift with weight, exercise can improve your symptoms. ConceiveAbilities: On that same note, I’ve spoken to many with PCOS patients who are trying to conceive that have been told by their doctors that they won’t cycle them unless they lose weight. It’s frustrating for them because they feel like they are in a catch-22 since difficulty losing weight is one of the symptoms of PCOS. Have you heard of this? Is this fair? Dr. Chen: My approach with every single couple is that unless you’re at an extreme, meaning you’re at a weight or have such high blood pressure or diabetes that it could be potentially dangerous, I say: “Let’s work on all of your health concerns at the same time.” We can try and work as a team at getting pregnant and getting healthier at the same time. Again, it depends on factors like weight, age and time and you have to look at the pros and cons to make an informed decision. An example is if you have a female patient who is 42 years old who is a little overweight. We should try to be aggressive to get healthy and get her weight down. We can weigh the pros and cons and it has to be an informed decision. She should be aggressive and try to get healthy while working to get pregnant, but with the understanding that should she get pregnant, she should continue to stay healthy and double her efforts to not gain more weight than recommended by her OB. If you have a younger patient who is overweight, you have a bit more time to perhaps give her to get healthier, lose some weight and then pursue fertility treatment. Ultimately though, every patient and every doctor is different and everyone has to feel comfortable – patient and doctor. ConceiveAbilities: What are some of the less obvious symptoms of PCOS that get missed or you feel don’t get mentioned often enough? Dr. Chen: Overall, I feel people focus too much on weight, when it should be about being healthy. If that was the priority, everything else (including the weight) will most likely fall into place. Some things I recommend is looking at your diet (healthy foods, veggies, etc.), making sure you are getting enough sleep (sleep is often something that gets overlooked) and exercise (again, I recommend cardio and strength training).ConceiveAbilities: Another thing I’ve heard often is how many PCOS patients are misdiagnosed or not properly diagnosed right away. What advice would you give to a woman if they sincerely feel they have PCOS but are not being properly diagnosed? Dr. Chen: That, to me, is an unfortunate function of our broken healthcare system. Patients naturally see their OB/GYN and they barely have time to write you a prescription for birth control pills let alone to really talk about a healthy lifestyle. What I find Is people with PCOS are typically just given pills or their cycles are regulated and that’s it because your doctor has twenty other patients they need to see so it’s not really addressing things. They don’t always have the time to look at your “story” over a period of years, and they need to investigate and see if there’s a pattern through puberty, if it’s a thyroid issue, etc.I feel like many patients truly don’t get a diagnosis until they really see a reproductive endocrinologist as it’s usually when they are trying to get pregnant that they are properly diagnosed. Conversations about reproductive health, history, patterns in family history, your period, overall health to wellness, diet, exercise all need to happen but it’s usually just a pap smear and contraception, so it’s not a good system. ConceiveAbilities: What’s difficult is some RE’s won’t see a patient unless they are trying to conceive too. What would you offer as a solution? Dr. Chen: You’re absolutely right! Some do though thankfully. I think the solution is to be proactive and to educate yourself as much as possible about your own healthcare to find your own OB/GYN and look into an RE if need be that WILL see you. A pap smear simply doesn’t solve all of your problems or answer all of your questions. ConceiveAbilities: You have been very active both in overall infertility advocacy but also, in advocating for PCOS research as well as endocrine disorders. How would you encourage those reading this to raise awareness around PCOS or advocate either for themselves or this condition? Dr. Chen: I feel like social media is a great tool as it’s a great way to communicate with a lot of people so take a look at Resolve: the National Infertility Association or an advocacy group. One of the biggest issues is to raise awareness because too many don’t know about or understand infertility. If you want good healthcare, it cannot be a passive process. ASRM and Resolve are both excellent sources because their information is really well vetted! Please follow her on Twitter and Instagram @DrSerenaHChen or visit her at www.sbivf.com.",

    "content": "Did you know that approximately 10% of pregnancies end in miscarriage? Even if you have never experienced a miscarriage yourself, it’s pretty likely that you know someone who has. Since they are so common, miscarriages do sometimes even occur during surrogacy pregnancies, regardless of a surrogate’s stellar medical history. Since you definitely can’t predict exactly what will happen in your surrogate pregnancy, it’s best to be prepared for various possibilities; this can make it easier to cope and move forward with the next steps, in the event that the pregnancy doesn’t go as planned. Possible Causes of Miscarriage Miscarriage is defined as “the loss of an intrauterine pregnancy within the first trimester”. Some of the many potential causes of miscarriage include: Chromosomal abnormalities (responsible for approximately 50% of miscarriages) Maternal health problems Drug or alcohol use The following risk factors for miscarriage have also been identified: Maternal age Previous miscarriages Uterine or cervical structural abnormalities Weight Invasive prenatal testing In most cases, miscarriage cannot be prevented. Your normal everyday activities, such as working and caring for your children, do not cause miscarriage. Instead, it is often nature’s way of telling us that a particular pregnancy was not viable due to genetic errors or abnormal fetal development. Since miscarriage is relatively common during the first three months of pregnancy, surrogates and intended parents often start to feel more confident about the pregnancy after the first trimester passes. What Happens During and After a Miscarriage? Miscarriage during your surrogate pregnancy may become apparent after you experience symptoms like bleeding and cramping. (Keep in mind that these symptoms do not always indicate an impending miscarriage, though.) Or, you may attend a routine medical appointment, where you learn that the gestational sac is empty, or the baby has stopped growing and doesn’t have a heartbeat. If any of these scenarios do occur, it is very important that you immediately seek and accept care from your medical provider, who will also advise you on your next steps. Effective treatment options for miscarriage may include: Expectant managementThis option lets the miscarriage progress on its own, allowing the tissue from the pregnancy to leave your body naturally. The length of time this process takes can vary significantly, possibly lasting anywhere from two to four weeks. As you might imagine, needing to wait for the inevitable to happen, or needing to endure unpleasant symptoms over this period of time, can be emotionally challenging. Medical treatmentIf you prefer to complete the miscarriage naturally but more quickly, your medical provider may prescribe medication to speed the process along. This medication, taken either orally or vaginally, causes your body to expel the pregnancy tissue, often within 24 hours. Some surrogates do report increased cramping with this method. Surgical treatmentA final option is to schedule a D&C (dilation and curettage), which is a minor surgical procedure often performed under general anesthesia in a hospital setting. This procedure involves dilation of the cervix and removal of the tissue inside the uterus. Luckily, complications from this procedure are uncommon; although there is typically mild cramping and light bleeding afterward, most women do resume their normal activities as soon as a day or two after the surgery. This treatment option does also offer the greatest possibility of being able to test the fetal tissue afterward, in the event a genetic abnormality that contributed to the pregnancy loss can be identified. As long as you don’t have an infection and you are not experiencing unusually heavy bleeding, your medical provider will likely ask you for your treatment preferences. Prior to making a decision, be sure that you know the risks versus benefits of each approach. For example, allowing the miscarriage to progress naturally does not necessarily mean that you will avoid a D&C. In many cases, miscarriages remain incomplete, which may also result in an eventual D&C. Psychological Effects of Miscarriage Aside from the physical consequences of a miscarriage, there are also significant emotional aspects to consider. Miscarriage is a loss that is always sad and painful for surrogates and intended parents. What You May Feel You may experience a wide range of emotions at different points in time, spanning from shock and anger to guilt, denial, and sadness. Since you are carrying someone else’s baby, you may also find that your emotions are surprising to you, in that they are “different” than what you expected or what you felt after having a miscarriage of your own in the past. Many surrogates who experience miscarriage report feelings of intense sadness for their intended parents, since it is the loss of their baby and their dream. This sadness feels different than the sadness you may encounter when losing your own pregnancy, and in some ways it may also feel more complicated. How to Cope with Your Emotions You may find it helpful to lean on your family and friends, your fellow ConceiveAbilities surrogates, your match manager, and your support group leader. They are all there to provide comfort; remind you that you are not alone; and encourage you to accept your feelings as they arise. Should you start feeling overwhelmed by your emotions, talk to a professional counselor or your medical provider. Navigating the Relationship with Your Intended Parents Your intended parents will also face complicated emotions, of course. While coping with their own grief, they may also be very concerned about your well-being, and how the miscarriage may impact their future family-building plans. While checking in with them after learning about the loss is a good idea, you may want to follow their lead with respect to communication after that point. If you’re not hearing from them as frequently, try not to take this personally. Keep in mind that they too are trying to heal emotionally from an extremely painful loss. Your ConceiveAbilities match manager may be able to offer some additional insight into their healing and thought processes, so feel free to ask. Determining Your Next Steps after Miscarriage After your miscarriage has completed, your medical provider will review the steps for your follow-up care, as well as tell you what to expect from your body afterward. Meanwhile, your intended parents will likely consult with the doctor at their fertility clinic to ask questions and seek recommendations for their next steps, too. Assuming that embryos remain and everyone is in agreement, many GCs and IPs will move forward with another embryo transfer together, after the surrogate’s body has healed and her menstrual cycle has returned. The length of time between a miscarriage and a subsequent embryo transfer will depend on your body, on the recommendations of your medical provider and the fertility doctor, and on all parties’ emotional readiness to proceed with another transfer. Remember, if you and your intended parents suffer a miscarriage during your surrogacy journey, you are not alone, and it does not necessarily signal the end of the journey or the relationship. Many ConceiveAbilities surrogates who have had miscarriages have gone on to carry and deliver perfectly healthy, bouncing babies for their intended parents! Written By Lori Jureko",

    "content": "Surrogacy is rapidly growing as a way to grow families. In 2019, surrogates were part of 5.4% of all in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures in 2019. Why? Surrogacy is the most successful treatment for infertility, with a 75% success rate. That number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. ConceiveAbilities has been helping hopeful people build their families by working with surrogate mothers and egg donors for 25 years, a time during which assisted reproductive technology has gone through a revolution. And, we’ve learned so much during that time as we’ve witnessed an entire generation of families come into being. We are invested in providing expert information needed to embark on a successful surrogacy journey. Whether you are building your family through surrogacy or becoming a surrogate or looking to egg donation, ConceiveAbilities’ All Things Conceivable blog is the best resource to learn about surrogacy and family-building. As an Intended Parent What is Surrogacy? What is Infertility? What are Infertility Treatments? How do Intended Parents find a Surrogate? How do Intended Parents Prepare for a Successful Surrogacy Journey? How Does Surrogacy Differ from One Part of the Country to Another? As an Potential Surrogate What is Surrogacy? Why Does Someone Become a Surrogate? How Do Surrogates Find Intended Parents? How do Surrogates Prepare for a Successful Surrogacy Journey? How Does Surrogacy Differ from One Part of the Country to Another? What is Surrogacy? Surrogacy is a modern and growing means of bringing new life into the world, where a woman carries a baby for another person or a couple. The intended parents undergo IVF meaning fertilization outside of the body, to transfer their embryo into the surrogate’s uterus. In our work at ConceiveAbilities, surrogates are not genetically or legally related to the baby and are compensated for their time and service by the intended parents. In 2019, more than 17,000 births took place by surrogate in the United States and the market is steadily growing at 15% per year based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And, in the past ten years, the percentage of all IVF transfers that took place with a gestational carrier grew more than 5-fold, from just over 1% to 5.4%. A surrogate, or gestational carrier, is a woman who carries a baby for an individual or a couple that has no genetic relationship to her. The person who is trying to have a baby with the help of the surrogate is known as an intended parent. At ConceiveAbilities, we work with intended parents who undergo IVF so that the surrogate can carry a baby to whom she is not genetically or legally related. The surrogate is paid for her time and efforts by the intended parent(s). The embryo is created from the intended father’s sperm, or donor sperm, and the intended mother’s egg, or donor egg. When the baby is born, the intended parents are listed on the birth certificate as the legal parents and assume all responsibility for the child. Founder and CEO, Nazca Fontes, shared ConceiveAbilities expert knowledge of the surrogacy process with Healthline for their article What Is Gestational Surrogacy. People often misunderstand what a gestational carrier, or surrogate, is. Today, in a modern surrogacy journey, a gestational surrogate has no genetic relation to the baby she is carrying for another person. In prior times, however, a traditional surrogate used her egg and also carried the baby for the intended family. Dr. Daniel Shapiro of Reproductive Biology Associates further explains the difference between a traditional vs gestational surrogate. To understand surrogacy success rates is to understand how and why surrogacy is the best chance in making a dream of a family come true. This data helps potential surrogate mothers have confidence that their time and commitment to helping a family is highly likely to have a joyous outcome. Learn more about how surrogacy works and why it’s the most successful fertility treatment. Why Does Someone Need a Surrogate? There are many reasons people choose surrogacy to make their dream of a family come true including infertility, medical reasons, and men who don’t have a uterus. Some women have medical reasons like our intended mother Kelly Cesare who had a heart transplant and survived cancer. She shared her story in the New York Post article Surrogacy Legal in NY: What This Means For New Yorkers. Intended parent Ashley Katzen shared her fertility journey and how she decided to use a surrogate to build her family in An Intended Parent’s Surrogacy Journey. And ConceiveAbilities Intended Families, Crystal Patel & Kunal Mody and Randy Rowe & Kyle Keigan shared their surrogacy journey with VeryWell Family. Between 10-20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. According to the March of Dimes, that number may be as high as 50% when we take into account pregnancies ending before a woman misses a menstrual cycle. Intended parent, Lara Beth Levy, shared how she and her husband chose to use a surrogate after suffering miscarriages with the NY Post. Not all surrogacy journeys begin with an infertility diagnosis. Some choose surrogacy for personal reasons. Surrogacy is also a highly successful option for the LGBTQ+ community and single men to become parents. Listen to A Single Dad’s Surrogacy Journey with Joseph Tito of The Dad Diaries to hear how Joseph, a single gay dad, became a father through his surrogacy journey. Learn more about the people a woman can help by becoming a surrogate in Six Reasons to Use a Surrogate Mother. Surrogates are so very needed and treasured to grow families. Learn more about all the reasons families and couples use a surrogate. What is Infertility? Infertility is defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner and is inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. In patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at six months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. Infertility affects 6.7 million women in the U.S., about 11% of the population’s reproductive-age population. It’s estimated that 1 in 8 couples (or 12% of married women) has trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy. Fertility declines as people age. A couple of ages 29-33 with a normal functioning reproductive system has only a 20-25% chance of conceiving in any month. After six months of trying, 60% of couples will conceive without medical assistance. Approximately one-third of infertility is attributed to the female partner, one-third to the male partner, and one-third is caused by a combination of problems in both partners or is unexplained. What causes infertility? There is a wide range of potential sources. For instance, one cause of female infertility is something called hostile cervical mucus, often referred to as a hostile uterus. Hashimoto’s disease is also linked to infertility and can make getting pregnant more difficult. That’s because decreased levels of thyroid hormone interfere with ovulation. Another cause of female infertility has to do with a hormone called prolactin. When levels of prolactin are high, it can be an indicator of deeper hormonal issues and, potentially, lead to infertility. Learn more about infertility and how it affects 1 in 8 couples. What Are Infertility Treatments? Some women seek infertility treatment using medicines like Letrozole to induce ovulation and improve endometrial thickness. Since Letrozole only addresses ovulation, it doesn’t impact other potential root causes of infertility. 40% of female infertility is related to tubal factor infertility. In order to get an official diagnosis, doctors may perform an hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test, a procedure that can help diagnose tubal occlusion or obstruction, as well as uterine malformations, pelvic inflammatory disease, and Asherman’s syndrome. Once confirmed, women may have a clearer understanding of the next steps to take in order to build their family. Couples that are pursuing infertility treatments may live on an emotional roller coaster, as each pregnancy attempt is high stakes. They learn the difference between a viable and non-viable pregnancy and, while a couple who suffers from a non-viable pregnancy may well find future success, repeated setbacks may lead the couple to consider a different path to build their family. Learn more about what are infertility treatments. How Do Intended Parents Find a Surrogate? A surrogacy journey requires a large team of professionals to reach the end goal of having a child. Finding the right surrogate to partner with can make all the difference in a successful surrogacy journey. Some intended parents choose to source their own surrogates and find themselves in a partnership that isn’t what they expected. A team of professionals is essential to find a surrogate who has shared values and expectations. A surrogacy journey is a deeply personal journey for both the intended parent and surrogate. ConceiveAbilities properly vets potential surrogates to ensure she is both physically and emotionally prepared to embark on a safe and healthy surrogacy journey. Because of our diligence, 95% of our surrogates pass fertility clinic medical clearance, saving loss of precious time and potential heartache of not being able to continue a surrogacy journey. Often, when people source their own surrogate, they are not prepared for the legal expertise and time it takes to manage a journey. ConceiveAbilities guides both parties through creating a legal contract outlining the surrogacy journey. Additionally, surrogacy laws are complex and differ from state to state and sometimes even county to county and can lead to difficult and expensive parentage and unnecessary stress in a time that should be joyous. A surrogacy journey is longer than a natural pregnancy. ConceiveAbilities ensures that intended parents and surrogates alike are educated and emotionally prepared for a longer journey. Your roadmap, built for you, is rooted in 25 years of experience in navigating clinic-by-clinic (and doctor-by-doctor) requirements for surrogate qualifications, state-by-state (and county-by-county) requirements for securing parentage, relationship dynamics between intended parents and gestational carriers in making important decisions, and the unique ups-and-downs that every surrogacy journey presents. ConceiveAbilities provides expertise in every facet of the journey to support your successful process, such as in-house mental health professionals, to the joyful outcome we all strive for: a healthy baby home with its parents. Learn more about success stories with ConceiveAbilities and how we match intended parents with the perfect surrogate. Why Does Someone Become a Surrogate? For many people, their path to parenthood has been challenging. Knowing that surrogacy gives them the best chance to hold their baby in their arms is remarkable. As more people turn to surrogacy, more women are finding themselves called to surrogacy. Why? ConceiveAbilities recently hired research firm Accelerant Research to better understand surrogates. The firm surveyed 100 surrogates, more than 500 qualified surrogacy prospects and more than 1,000 women from the general population. Of the surrogates and qualified surrogacy prospects, Accelerant found: More than half volunteer regularly Nearly half are registered blood and organ donors Almost one-quarter of them foster pets More than three-quarters said they did so because they knew someone personally in need Two-thirds said they had first-hand exposure to a relative or close friend’s struggle with weighing the infertility “We found that the single biggest motivation for surrogates is the simple desire to help,” Nazca Fontes, CEO of ConceiveAbilities shared. “Eighty-seven percent said they find joy in helping others; 74 percent reported they are motivated by a sense of empowerment as a surrogate.” Other driving factors include that 78 percent of these women know someone in need and 68 percent want to support the LGBTQ community. Deciding to become a surrogate is a deeply personal and courageous decision. There is a lot of information about surrogacy to research. Listen to our podcast Busting Surrogacy Myths with OB-GYN Dr. Heather Carlson who explains the facts of surrogacy and dispels some surrogate misconceptions. One of the biggest surrogacy myths is that the surrogate is genetically related to the baby. ConceiveAbilities surrogates have no genetic relationship to the intended parent(s)’ child. It is important to understand the process of gestational surrogacy and the motivation behind why women want to become a surrogate. A woman thinking about becoming a surrogate may want to know what could disqualify her in the surrogate application process. Our team is always on hand to answer any questions and provide support throughout the process of learning about surrogacy. For women considering becoming a surrogate, the best resource we can provide is personal experience. Many of our surrogates have volunteered to be advocates to speak directly with women thinking about being a surrogate. Our surrogates’ stories have also been featured in their local news including: Andrea Brenes in Miami Mom Collective’s One Amazing Mama Shares Why She Became a Surrogate, Kristi Graves in How To Become a Surrogate in Denver and Briana Buck in Charlotte Mom of Two Earns $52,000 As A Surrogate. Learn more about what inspires women to become a surrogate, factors that play into her decision to give the gift of family and what matters most to her throughout her surrogacy journey in How To Decide To Become A Surrogate Mother. What are the requirements to be a surrogate? The most important requirements are quite basic: she must have given birth before and she must be a US citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Check out Surrogate Medical Requirements FAQs to review the basic qualifications and find answers to frequently asked questions about becoming a surrogate. The Age Limit for Surrogate Mothers outlines why age is such an important factor in becoming a surrogate. Many women also want to know if they can become a surrogate after a tubal ligation. Find out why having a tubal ligation can actually be advantageous for a woman in a surrogacy journey. We encourage all women who feel they have been called to become a surrogate to learn about the full process of How To Become A Surrogate Mother. Learn more about why does someone become a surrogate. How Do Surrogates Find Intended Parents? Choosing the right surrogacy agency provides a surrogate with proper compensation, legal and financial support, and protection throughout their surrogacy journey. Partnering with an experienced surrogate agency prevents a surrogate from experiencing hardships and pitfalls that can occur in a surrogacy journey, especially when a surrogate is choosing to partner with the family she was meant to help. Matching with the right family is a top priority for a surrogate. A surrogate is a partner in the surrogacy process. Through our Matching Matters™, ConceiveAbilities takes into consideration personal preferences to help pair a surrogate with the perfect family for her that has shared expectations and values. A surrogate is bravely giving the gift of family and should be focused on what matters most, taking care of herself and her family while carrying the baby. ConceiveAbilities allows surrogates to do that by having a surrogate process in place. Without an agency, much of the paperwork, communication and arrangements fall to the surrogate and are time consuming. ConceiveAbilities ensures a surrogate’s needs are protected. Financially, our surrogacy agency vets and creates financial assurance to secure surrogate compensation and all the resources needed for the surrogacy journey to be a successful one. We provide legal guidance to make sure a surrogate’s rights are met throughout every step of the surrogacy journey. Our agency ensures a surrogate has proper health insurance, medical coverage and life insurance, is fairly compensated, legally protected, and physically and mentally supported throughout every step of a surrogacy journey. Learn more about how do surrogates find intended parents. How Do Intended Parents Prepare for a Successful Surrogacy Journey? Understanding the surrogacy process is important for a successful journey. There are many myths and misconceptions about surrogacy, including Does a Surrogate Mother Share DNA with the Baby? and Do Surrogates Get Attached To The Baby? Dispelling myths and researching concerns is important to feel comfortable through every step of the surrogacy process. In addition to researching the process of surrogacy, intended parents need a plan to pay for a surrogacy journey. At the outset, that may seem straightforward but it requires a thorough understanding of the full cost of surrogacy. Our All-In Program for intended parents, a first-of-its-kind offering, leverages our 25 years of experience to offer the most comprehensive and risk-free surrogacy program in the market. One of the more important decisions for intended parents is how to create embryos. For instance, an intended mother can choose to harvest her own eggs even after a hysterectomy. Many hopeful parents will need to find a great egg donor. ConceiveAbilities is a pioneer in the egg donor business and has grown into a full family fertility agency by always putting the security of intended parents and egg donors first. From application through retrieval, we make sure each party has the egg donor information needed, including the egg donation timeline, so each party is as informed and empowered as possible. Learn more about how do intended parents prepare for a successful surrogacy journey here. How Do Surrogates Prepare for a Successful Surrogacy Journey? Deciding to become a surrogate is an important decision for a surrogate and her family. Timing, the right match and the right support is just the start of How To Prepare for a Successful Surrogate Pregnancy. Our surrogates are driven by a tremendous sense of joy in helping another family. Being aware of the pros and cons of surrogacy is integral when deciding if becoming a surrogate is the right decision. Managing the process well is essential to a successful surrogacy journey.

    "content": "Hopeful parents approach egg donation for a variety of reasons. Though you likely already know that using an egg donor can significantly increase your chances of a successful IVF outcome, you may not understand all of the logistics. There are many factors that go into choosing an egg donor who is the right fit for you. Undoubtedly, you want a “good egg,” and to work with the best of the best. Many intended parents hope their children will resemble them, so perhaps your ideal egg donor has similar features to you or your partner. There are other aspects that some feel strongly about such as ethnicity, education, hobbies or even religion of the egg donor. Ultimately, there are no right or wrong answers. It’s more about what attributes you feel are a “need” to have versus a “nice” to have. Our process works to present you with only the best choices so you can confidently and easily choose an egg donor. What are the requirements to become an egg donor? Before you consider what factors are important to you personally, you should first understand that there are a number of requirements to become an egg donor. While some rely on a friend or relative to donate their eggs, working with a donor through a reputable agency ensures that she has been thoroughly vetted. Someone in the ConceiveAbilities donor program must meet the following criteria: Egg donors are typically between the ages of 21 – 28 years old, when egg quality is at its highest Willing and able to respond to communication within 24 hours from our team and clinic staff Have regular monthly periods No reproductive disorders or abnormalities BMI under 28 Non-nicotine user, non-smoker, non-drug user Willing to commit to the process for a minimum of 6 months Excited about the process of helping to build a family Egg donors are vetted for mental and physical health, as well as a review of their family medical and genetic history. How to choose an egg donor? That is the big question, and one perhaps only you and your partner can answer. While there are different categories to consider, it ultimately comes down to what is vitally important to you. Physical attributes This can cover a wide range. For example, should ethnicity be a factor? For some, this is critical. Whether it’s that you and your partner have a certain complexion, eye color, hair color or build, the appearance of your donor and the chance of having a child who looks like you may be exceptionally important. It’s important to keep in mind that we never know exactly what will happen when we combine DNA, a fact that applies to 100% biological children too. Still, it’s perfectly reasonable to seek a donor who bears a physical resemblance to you or your partner. Personal background Is she intelligent? Do you know anything about her personality, education or career? Is she musically inclined or good at math? If there is an aspect in this area that is important to you (example: you play the piano and would love someone to play a duet with), these are things to think about. Medical history While your donor has been properly vetted, you’ll likely want to consider her personal and family health history. Certain factors may not disqualify her as a donor candidate, but when considering yours and your partner’s history, may not make her the ideal candidate for you. It’s a good idea to discuss any questions you have about a donor’s medical history with your doctor. Remember, she will also undergo a medical screening at your clinic to further review her health. Has your donor ever donated before? There are a few reasons you may want to consider this when making your decision. Keep in mind that every cycle is unique with many variables; while previous cycle information may show that it resulted in a pregnancy or birth, it’s more important to focus on the fact that she has been through the process before and knows what to expect. A successful previous cycle also means that your child will be genetically tied to others. This may or may not matter to you, and the decision is entirely up to you and your partner. Fresh vs frozen egg donation? Some of the immediate questions when it comes to deciding between a fresh versus frozen cycle are success rates and costs. It’s worth noting that thanks to the somewhat recent technology of vitrification (which “flash freezes” eggs, preserving their integrity), the success rates for frozen versus fresh are close to the same. Regardless of whether you pursue fresh or frozen egg donation, the cost of donor eggs is not inexpensive. In general there are pros and cons to fresh versus frozen egg donation. Here are some advantages to each: Using fresh donor eggs In fresh cycles, the egg donor typically helps just one or two families, so the number of children genetically related to the donor is minimalThere’s a potential opportunity to speak with the egg donor to learn more about herYou will have a greater chance of having biological siblings later, should you choose to expand your family, as you may be able to freeze extra embryos for later useFresh eggs have slightly higher improved fertilization rates Using frozen donor eggs There will be no delays or waiting to start your cycle as theneed for “cycle synchronization” would be eliminatedYour IVF treatment could be scheduled at your convenience.Frozen donor eggs tend to be more affordableYou increase your chances of receiving mature eggs and decrease your chances of a cancelled cycle Should you choose an egg donor on your own? When it comes to sorting through these decisions, we want what you want: to successfully build your family. While there may seem like an overwhelming amount of egg donor profiles to sort through and a profound list of details to ponder, remember: between our years of experience and support, your “need to have” list and that little bit of magic that says, “Yes! That’s the one!”, we can help you choose which is the right donor for you. We know our donors and, after getting to know you and your needs, we can help you find that exceptional candidate you’re looking for. Contact us today to take those first baby steps to your baby!",

    "content": "The decision to become a surrogate means entering into a unique partnership with the intended parents. Think about it: you’re taking on an incredibly powerful responsibility, and it’s often for someone you’ve never met. One of the most important decisions you’ll make during your surrogacy journey is the people you’ll enter into this partnership with. What should you consider when being matched with intended parents? From working with a surrogacy agency to communication and beyond, we’ll explore how to make the very most of your match. Should I work with a surrogacy agency to match with intended parents? There are several ways to go about a surrogacy arrangement. Some choose to work with an intended parent they already know, in what is often referred to as compassionate or altruistic surrogacy. These arrangements involve little if any compensation, and are also without the benefit of the many safeguards provided by an agency. Some women choose to go this route because it is the most accessible option where they live; in Australia and Canada, for example, only altruistic surrogacy is permitted. Others choose it for the sake of familiarity with the intended parents. It’s important to remember, however, that there is a greater risk of strain on the relationship. Surrogacy is full of ups and downs, and while these can all be managed, it is immensely helpful to have the guidance of an experienced agency. Working with an agency to match with intended parents means protective measures to mitigate risks are put into place for all parties involved – something that just can’t be said of independent surrogacy. Things to consider while choosing a surrogacy agency While working with a surrogacy agency is certainly the safest option, it can also be overwhelming with so many options to research. We’ve broken it down into a few categories to consider when choosing a surrogacy agency. It will set the course for the rest of your surrogacy journey, so it’s crucial to ask questions and make an informed choice. Reputation. What do other surrogates, intended parents and clinics have to say about them? Do they adhere to the surrogacy guidelines set by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine? Due to the large number of agencies across the United States, filtering out poor performing ones will help narrow your search. Experience of staff. Experience counts in a process like surrogacy, which requires a unique and precise level of understanding. What can the staff offer from a business, mental health and legal perspective? Consider, too, how many years the agency has been in business. Longevity is another good sign that the agency is well-equipped to deal with any challenge. Resources and support. A solid agency will have the experience to provide a variety of resources, anything from insurance to a surrogacy escrowto postpartum support. Consider who, if anyone, will be your go-to from the agency over the course of your surrogacy journey. Will you have a designated support person? Communication is key during this process, from you and from the agency. (More on that later!) What to look for when pairing with Intended Parents? Once you’ve settled on an agency, you’ll have plenty of support as you determine your best intended parent match. As you’ll quickly learn, the right match is crucial to a successful surrogate experience. In fact, outside of immediate family, there are few relationships more important than that of a surrogate and intended parent. And regardless of what kind of relationship you plan to have with one another, it’s important to be on the same page. A few points to consider: Do you prefer to connect via email, phone or text? Some surrogates and intended parents remain in regular contact during the pregnancy, whether it’s through phone calls or photos and texts. Some prefer to keep a more professional relationship, and that’s fine too. The types of communication vary, and these are points to discuss prior to your match so that our team can find intended parents with similar preferences. Will the attended parents be attending appointments? If the intended parents are local, they may or may not want to attend appointments with your medical practitioner. If they can’t be there in person, do they want to Skype or FaceTime? Would they just like an update afterward? And if the intended parents live far away, will they attend the 20-week appointment and anatomy scan? What about a birth plan? It’s important to discuss these details in advance, which is something your designated match manager will help you navigate. What does future contact look like? While it can be tough to know exactly how your relationship with the intended parents will look after the baby is born, consider whether you would like to remain in contact with them. For some, a photo may be exchanged here and there, but the relationship was primarily for the duration of the pregnancy. Again, this is just fine and may even be your preference. The agency will discuss these possibilities with you prior to your match, and will likely encourage this conversation during your match meeting. Communication and support for you as a surrogate While you’re probably excited to get started, it’s understandable that you’ve also got plenty of questions! That’s where communication is key; from start to finish, communication and support from your team makes all the difference in a positive surrogacy experience. Like we mentioned previously, connecting with your agency is imperative. You should be in regular communication with someone from the agency who can answer questions and provide general support as needed. This may look a little different with your intended parents. Part of our surrogacy process takes into account your comfort level with contact. So regardless of whether you prefer limited communication or regular texts, our team considers this when making a match. Support looks different for everyone, and our goal is to respect and honor the needs of everyone involved. Matching methodology Matching is one of the very first, incredibly crucial steps in a surrogacy journey. And there’s no app for that; a surrogate match requires precision and attention to the most minute details. “Our process provides a 97% success rate on the first meeting. We create matches that work across all dimensions of the surrogacy journey – from lifestyle, to health, to communication style,” explains Nazca Fontes, Founder and CEO of ConceiveAbilities. “Our attention to detail and experience makes all the difference.” At ConceiveAbilities, our matching methodology is designed to account for the most vital factors of this journey, including intensive medical and psychological screening to thoroughly vet compatibility. Taking all of these things into account, plus conversations with you and with the intended parents, our team is able to make the best possible match. And, of course, you’ll get to make the final call. After a match meeting with the intended parents, both parties must agree whether or not to move forward. Finally, it’s important to consider surrogate reviews and testimonials. You can’t get any better insight than from someone who has been there; ask the agency to connect you with a previous gestational carrier. She can answer questions and share wisdom like no one else can. “This experience has been one that has changed me as a person, mother, friend and wife,” explains previous surrogate Tisha. Andrea, another previous surrogate, found the mutual support of other surrogates to be especially important. “The support we are able to give and receive is such a beautiful thing,” she says. If you’re ready to explore the unique gift of surrogacy, we are ready to guide you every step of the way. Contact our team for answers to all your questions and to get started with your surrogacy match.",

    "content": "Samantha knew from the very start that she wanted to carry for an LGBT family. Inspired by witnessing her sister-in-law’s struggle to have a child, Samantha applied to ConceiveAbilities surrogacy program with the intention of doing all she could for others facing similar challenges. In May of 2019, she delivered a dream-fulfilling baby boy for married gay dads. We recently caught up with Samantha and asked her a bit about her experience being a surrogate for a gay couple. We so appreciate her taking the time to provide us with the below responses. Samantha’s Interview: 1) How would you describe yourself? Samantha: I am originally from California but we moved to Oregon about five years ago. My husband and I have a two-year-old son. I would describe myself as easy-going, fun and simple. 2) What does your family do for fun? Samantha: My two-year-old loves playing outside. We also enjoy just spending time together as well as watching television shows as a family. 3) Was your young son interested in your belly when you were pregnant? Samantha: Yes! He was very interested in my belly. He liked to tell people “that the baby is going to his destination.” So he would rub my belly and say, “okay, the baby is going to his destination now.” Whenever he sees a baby on television he always asks if it is the surrogate baby. 4) It sounds like you came in knowing you wanted to help a same-sex couple. Did anything in particular inspire this? Samantha: Yes. I wanted to be matched with a same-sex couple because my sister-in-law is a lesbian. She had a hard time and struggled with IVF. Watching her go through that definitely made me want to help another family. 5) Were your extended family and friends supportive of your journey? Did you receive any negative comments? Samantha: At first, my mother-in-law was not sure about what I was doing, but she is supportive now and loves to tell people that I was a surrogate. The only negative comment I ever received was from a gentleman who told me “Well, I would never allow my wife to do that.” 6) Did your husband have any hesitations about your becoming a surrogate or about carrying for same sex couple? Samantha: My husband did not have any hesitations about my becoming a surrogate. He was all on-board. Same thing with being matched with a same-sex couple. His sister is a lesbian so same-sex relationships are familiar to us. 7) What was your match meeting like? Samantha: I do not really remember my match meeting that well. It was more than a year ago. My first impression was that my Intended Parents seemed really nice. We liked them right off the bat. They did look tired as they had young children already! 8) How do you think carrying for a same-sex couple is different than carrying for a heterosexual couple or a single IP? Samantha: My intended parents were very understanding of my personal space, which was terrific. During delivery, as well as the rest of the journey, they said “as long as the baby is safe, it is your body, do what you want to do.” That was so helpful. It definitely helped me to know that they trusted me. 9) Where did you deliver and did you feel supported by the hospital staff? Samantha: I delivered at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital. The hospital staff and nurses were very supportive and caring. The parents actually brought the hospital staff doughnuts because they felt so supported! 10) Has carrying for a gay couple impacted your life in any particular way? Samantha: Carrying for them made me feel more confident. I do not know how that is even possible…but carrying for them made me feel so confident in what I am capable of and made me open my eyes to learn how I can help out even more. 11) Any particular memories about delivery day? Were the Dads in the room for the birth? Samantha: I had to be induced, which happened on May 4th at 10:00 pm. The Dads flew half-way across the country from Nebraska. Their flight left at 4:00 am. They made it to Portland at 10:00 am and arrived at the hospital at 11:00 am. I delivered at 1:39 pm! I do not remember this but they told me that “The Lion King” was playing in the background while I was delivering. So they gave us a painting of the Lion King, which was so thoughtful. I do not remember much more because I received the epidural at about 6:00 am and slept until pushing so…not much more to tell! 12) Are you still in touch with your IPs? How often do you get updates? Samantha: We are still in touch. I get updates about once every three to four weeks. It is truly awesome– they send me pictures of how chunky he has grown. They sent me his birth announcement just recently which was pretty cool. 13) What should a woman who is considering carrying for a same-sex couple keep in mind? Samantha: Keep ‘em updated! They do not know anything about what is going on with your body. I sent my IPs a weekly picture of my belly so they could see the progress of how their baby was growing. It was not much but it was something simple I was able to do for them. I called them when I lost my mucus plug, for example. Just keeping them updated on small things is really helpful. 14) Any other comments? Samantha: They are very good dads! You can tell they have loved him since before he was born. They both cried during delivery which was so awesome! ConceiveAbilities’ mission is to help everyone who wants to become a parent to realize that dream. Our agency is committed to supporting gay parenting and family building for both same-sex couples as well as single individuals in the LGBT community. Learn more on our website. Matching Matters Methodology Our surrogate matching process brings together the right surrogate with the right intended parent for a relationship that creates a family. Our matching process is designed to account for the most vital factors of this journey, including intensive medical and psychological screening to thoroughly vet compatibility. This precise matching system results in shortened timelines and rewarding relationships between our surrogates and their intended parents. Our Matching Matters methodology means that the unique legal considerations, relevant to our same-sex clients, are taken into consideration from the very start of the surrogate matching process. Samantha was matched with her IPs due in part to her desire to work with a same-sex family. Her home state of Oregon, providing an appropriate venue for the surrogacy birth was also a consideration. Her intended parents’ preferences as well as many other variables were analyzed prior to introduction by our matching expert. Learn more about Matching Matters on our website.",

    "content": "PCOS Awareness Month is a federally designated month that aims to increase awareness around Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is one of the most common ovulatory disorders, accounting for 25 percent of infertility cases and can potentially create other medical issues such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as well as cancer. PCOS is a health problem that affects 1 in 10 women so taking this opportunity to help educate girls, women and the public about this condition can not only help the future health of so many but it can also assist in the care of those already diagnosed. The more you know about what your options are, the more you’ll be able to advocate for yourself! What is PCOS? PCOS is typically caused by an imbalance of hormones. The hormonal imbalance creates problems in your ovaries. Girls and women who have PCOS tend to have an elevated level of male hormones, which creates a chain effect involving your entire menstrual cycle. Having a hormonal imbalance means your ovaries are not able to make the hormones needed for an egg to fully mature. That can prevent you from ovulating. If you’re not ovulating, you aren’t producing the amount of progesterone you need. Without progesterone, your menstrual cycle can become irregular or stop completely. If you’retrying to conceive with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, this “PCOS Chain Reaction” can make your efforts rather difficult! Symptoms of PCOS The signs and symptoms of PCOS can vary amongst individuals. The most common signs include irregular or infrequent periods and polycystic ovaries. Making matters more complicated is in some cases, some girls and women have no discernible signs of the condition. Below are the list of the most basic and common symptoms (in alphabetical order): Acne, oily skin and dandruff Depression or anxiety Enlarged ovaries and/or an increased follicle number Excessive hair growth on your face, chest, etc. Infrequent, missed or irregular menstrual periods Insulin resistance/diabetic like symptoms Male pattern baldness or thinning hair Pelvic pain Sleep apnea Thick, dark brown or black patches of skin Weight gain or obesity or difficulty losing weight What to do if you suspect you have PCOS? While you may not have every single symptom listed above, if some of the above resonate with you or if you have any concerns whatsoever, you should consult with a Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE). He or she should be able to diagnose you through an ultrasound, a pelvic exam, blood tests and a review of your medical history. Being aware of PCOS and receiving treatment early can greatly help in getting the condition under control. If I Have PCOS, Do I Need A Surrogate? If you are diagnosed with PCOS and are trying to build your family, you have several family building options. Depending on your particular situation, your doctor may recommend first trying an oral medication called Clomid and timed cycles, or they may suggest employing Assisted Reproductive Technology like intrauterine insemination [IUI] or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Most likely, there would be attempts taken first before the subject of surrogacy would be explored. In certain cases, since some experience insulin resistance and diabetic like complications due to their PCOS, they are more likely to experience gestational diabetes. They also have a higher chance of experiencing preeclampsia. Both mean that they might be at a higher risk of giving birth prematurely and/or needing a C-Section. While that will most likely not prevent you from carrying your own child, you should feel comfortable discussing this with your doctor. Only you and your physician can truly decide what’s the best, safest and healthiest plan to expand your family. If you do find yourself in need of a surrogate, please register to learn more. If you would like more clarity on ConceiveAbilities’ surrogacy program and process please visit our surrogacy process page on our website. Raising Awareness Around PCOS For now, we hope you will take some time this month and become familiar with several resources around PCOS. Below are several groups that can help educate you about this condition and we encourage you to help spread the word as you never know who you’ll be helping or educating! PCOS Challenge PCOS Awareness Association Androgen Excess and PCOS Society Resolve: The National Infertility Association And as always, please feel free to contact us should you have any questions!",

    "content": "Is it possible to be single and become a surrogate? Yes, single mothers can absolutely become gestational carriers. So, you are considering becoming a gestational surrogate but are wondering if your marital status of single or divorced will prevent your acceptance into a reputable program. Fear not, your single (or divorced) status is not an eliminating factor. Single women can absolutely become surrogates and are very much encouraged to apply. As a responsible single mother, you likely already have a strong support system in place. As is the case with many single applicants, the relationships, arrangements, and networks which support your family’s regular routine can likely be relied upon throughout your journey as a surrogate. At ConceiveAbilities (and likely other reputable agencies), your marital status is less important than the overall stability of your life and your established support system. Can I Become a Surrogate If I am Separated? Reputable agencies have many requirements for acceptance into their surrogacy program. While a status of “married” is not required, we do want to be clear that ConceiveAbilities does not accept applicants who are legally, officially, or unofficially “separated.” If you are in the middle of an adjustment to your marital status or are very recently divorced, now is likely not the right time to begin a surrogacy journey. Our acceptance team typically requires applicants to have a settled status of “single” or officially “divorced” for a few months prior to beginning their journey. There may be other agencies who are not as particular about this requirement, but that should give you pause. ConceiveAbilities has been helping to build families for over twenty-five years. In that time, we have gained many valuable insights about what it takes to have a smooth journey. We know from our success that starting off from a settled position truly is worth the wait. What are the requirements to become a surrogate? To learn more about the requirements of our surrogacy program, please visit our website. Established Support Network: Your Tribe As a single mother you likely already have a network of support built into your life. Perhaps your parents or ex in-laws take an active role in childcare. Perhaps you have a sibling, close friends, or a network of trusted neighbors whom you have claimed as “your tribe” and help you meet the challenges of modern single parenting. It is not important what your support network looks like, but it is important that you have one you can count on. As a single woman considering surrogacy it is worth considering the below questions prior to applying. -Do I have appropriate childcare so that I will be able to attend required medical appointments related to my surrogacy journey?-Can my support system reasonably cover my going out of town for 2-4 days?-Can my support system be relied upon to step up if my doctor ordered bed rest?-Is my employment situation appropriately flexible to accommodate this journey?-What are my dating intentions? Can I commit to the phases of sexual abstention which will be required throughout my journey?-Am I done building my own family?-Who will be my support system during delivery for myself, my child(ren), etc. If after honest reflection you have no hesitations and feel ready to become a surrogate, then it is probably the time to reach out to a surrogacy agency. They will guide you through your next steps and provide an additional support network through their programs. What is the Surrogate Sisterhood? At ConceiveAbilities, our Surrogate Sisterhood is a community of surrogates who have build personal connections with one another through a shared private Facebook group, monthly check-ins, regional events, and monthly group support meetings, managed by mental health professionals. This means that with ConceiveAbilities, you will not only have the expertise of staff to guide you, but the unique perspectives and experiences of women who are walking the same path as you. Surrogacy may be challenging, but you can rest assured that you’ll never have to overcome the obstacles on your own. The Sisterhood is there for you. The Benefits of Using a Surrogacy Agency as a Single Mother The calling to be a surrogate does not discriminate based on marital status, and neither does the lengthy list of support resources available to our surrogates. There are unique legal, mental health, matching and general support aspects which are also relevant to your journey as a single or divorced woman. A reputable agency will be well versed in these special considerations and entirely capable of effortlessly navigating you through them all. ConceiveAbilities offers the benefit of in-house licensed mental health professionals who are there to guide you through every mental and emotional peak and valley along the way. In addition to ongoing counseling, we are here to advocate and support you through any curveballs you encounter. We provide multiple channels of support to assure that you feel secure and confident throughout your entire journey. It’s important to remember that going through surrogacy single is not synonymous with going through surrogacy alone. Matching Matters ConceiveAbilities believes that finding the right match between a surrogate and intended parent is paramount to a successful surrogacy. Often, applicants will ask whether their status as a single or divorced woman will affect their match time. Our matching process takes everything from communication style to desired boundaries after the birth into account to ensure that all parties’ needs are met throughout and even after the pregnancy. Your status as a single or divorced woman will be considered by our matching experts and will be a part of the comprehensive analysis used to find you the right intended parents. We understand that you are so much more than your marital status, as do our intended parents. The majority are contemporary, open-minded people who trust us with playing a major role in helping build their families. There is a mutual understanding that we are picky with selecting gestational carriers, and our intended parents know that we would not create a match with someone who we don’t deem as an all-around wonderful human being who is fully equipped for the road ahead. Unique Legal Considerations Surrogacy laws can be complicated and they can vary by state or county. Depending on which jurisdiction is relevant to your journey, your status as single or divorced may require a unique analysis. The good news is that with a reputable agency, you do not have to think twice about these factors. Your status will be fully considered and accounted for so that you are completely protected, and the agency’s legal partners seamlessly avoid all confusion and potential long term legal consequences. You will not be the first or only single or divorced woman in our program. Our expertise is in the experience and capability to navigate any unique legalities that apply to your journey as a single surrogate. Conclusion If you feel like you are ready to give the gift of surrogacy, do not allow your “single” marital status to dissuade your decision in any way. It is important to honestly consider your existing support system to ensure they are as committed to your journey as you are, but your confidence that you are ready and have the support you need is much more essential than your status of married, single, or divorced. Once you are prepared to take the next step, working with a reputable surrogacy agency will provide a wealth of additional legal, mental health, and general support resources to ensure a smooth and successful surrogacy as a single surrogate. Some of the most wonderful surrogates we have ever worked with are single- in fact, the single ladies have created their own Facebook group for additional support. ConceiveAbilities welcomes any single or divorced women who are prepared to follow their calling to be a part of the sisterhood, and we’ll be behind you every step of the way.

    "content": "You may have heard or seen the quote, “Parenthood requires love. Not DNA.” When it comes to expanding your family, these words are so very true. While we may not have built our family in the way we initially imagined, thanks to options like IVF, surrogacy and donor eggs, parenthood has been made possible for thousands. Egg donor recipient Whether you’re in a same-sex male relationship, you’ve been diagnosed with an infertility condition that has impacted your ovarian reserve or there is a genetic concern with eggs, these are all various scenarios where you might explore egg donation. It’s also more common than you may realize. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an “Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report of 2012” which states that 12 percent of all IVF cycles in the United States–approximately 16,000 a year–involve eggs retrieved from a donor. Medical definition In general, if you’re a woman unable to conceive with your own eggs or in a male same-sex relationship, you can have IVF treatment using donated eggs. The donor eggs are combined with your partner’s or donor’s sperm, and the resulting embryo(s) are transferred to the intended mother or gestational surrogate’s uterus. Who can benefit from egg donation? There are several reasons why using an egg donor might be your most viable option of becoming a parent: You are a woman who has a genetic condition that you do not want to pass on to your children You are of advanced maternal age (typically over the age of 42 years old) You have been diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR) You have had an inadequate response to ovulation induction You have been diagnosed with premature menopause You have been diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) Your ovaries have had to be removed due to a medical issue You’re in a same-sex male relationship and plan to build your family through surrogacy What’s the cost of using an egg donor? There are various ways you can pursue using donor eggs and that would affect the cost of using an egg donor. In general, the cost can be expensive. Frozen donor eggs can be less expensive than pursuing fresh donor eggs so that is one way to save money. Overall, there are pros and cons to using fresh and frozen eggs that you can review by reading our blog, “Fresh vs. Frozen Donor Eggs: The Pros and Cons”. What is the success rate of IVF with donor eggs? What’s encouraging is not only is the use of donor eggs quite common, but the success rates are quite high. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in their “Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report of 2012”, in vitro fertilization with donor eggs has the highest success rate of any fertility treatment– 56 percent, nationally. In addition, as per the American Pregnancy Association, approximately 48 percent of women using donor eggs will achieve a pregnancy. The steps to receiving eggs from a donor The steps below can vary as it depends if you pursue fresh or frozen donor eggs. If you were to pursue fresh, the steps would breakdown to be the following: When the intended mother is matched with a donor or if they are using someone they know, their menstrual cycles will be synchronized The donor will begin her fertility medications where she will be monitored for approximately 10 to 14 days before her eggs are retrieved for donation The intended mother or surrogate will begin taking progesterone supplements before the embryo transfer to help support the lining of the uterus which encourages embryo implantation The donor egg is fertilized with the sperm from a spouse, partner or donor. One or two embryos will be transferred through the cervix into the uterus of the intended mother or surrogate at either a fertility clinic or a hospital Anywhere from 10 to 14 days after the embryo transfer, the intended mother or surrogate will have blood work done to confirm a potential pregnancy If the recipient is pregnant, she would continue to take the progesterone and estrogen supplements as directed by until the end of week 10 or 12 of the pregnancy If the intended mother is using an egg bank, this typically expedites the process as cycles would not have to be synchronized. A frozen donor egg would be chosen, thawed, and fertilized when the intended parents were ready. The rest of the timeline would be similar. How can you find an egg donor? Some intended parents use an egg donor who is known to them, such as a relative or a willing close family friend. Others feel more comfortable using an anonymous donor. There are egg donor matching programs, egg banks with a diverse selection to choose from and there are even some fertility clinics that have a donor egg program. At ConceiveAbilities, we have an in-house program where each candidate is carefully screened for mental and physical health as well as given a review of their family medical and genetic history. We know our donors very well and can help you find your ideal match. In the end, you must decide what works best for you, your partner and your future family. It’s true what they say–whether your children have your DNA or not–we’re certain they will have all your love.Contact us to learn more!",

    "content": "A term you’re likely to see come up as you take a deeper dive into requirements for surrogates is “BMI,” or “body mass index.” With so much information at hand, questions are bound to arise such as: “What exactly IS a BMI? Is my BMI normal? Is BMI really a requirement for becoming a surrogate, or just a guideline?” The importance of BMI, how to calculate your own, and why it is essential for surrogates to fall within a specific BMI range are all key pieces of knowledge to have in mind as you begin your surrogacy journey. What is BMI and why is it important? Simply put, BMI, or body mass index, is a measurement that represents a relationship between a person’s height and weight. It is calculated by dividing an individual’s body weight by their height. While it is, of course, not the only factor in assessing overall health, BMI provides a more accurate estimate of a person’s total body fat than the number on a scale. A higher BMI can be indicative of higher amount of body fat as a percentage of total weight, which is an important factor in assessing health risks that can lead to dangerous pregnancies such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Other health concerns that can be associated with a higher BMI include: Sleep apnea Arthritis Hypertension Diabetes and gestational diabetes Multiple forms of cancer In the same way that it is important to eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and have check-ins with your healthcare professional, it is important to know your BMI and understand the impact it can have on both long and short term health. While not a perfect indicator of potential health risks, BMI is a crucial part of the total picture of your comprehensive health. It is especially important to know if you are entering the surrogacy screening process. A BMI below 35, and ideally below 30, is a starting qualification and requirement to be a surrogate with ConceiveAbilities. Although BMI is not the only way to determine a health or pregnancy risk, there are multiple health risks to both the surrogate and the baby that have been linked to a BMI above these values. Hypertension and subsequent circulation loss to the baby, gestational diabetes, plus sleep apnea and its associated links to heart failure and intrauterine growth restriction are just a few examples of why ConceiveAbilities requires all surrogates to have a BMI below these values at the time that their surrogacy journey begins. It is simply not worth risking the health of the women we work with as surrogates, or risking a healthy pregnancy, to sidestep this requirement. What is a normal BMI? According to the World Health Organization, a normal BMI falls between 18.5 and 25. A BMI between 25 to 30 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 is considered obese. A BMI lower than 18.5 is considered underweight. Before you make any drastic lifestyle changes, it’s important to remember that BMI is calculated using only height and weight measurements. It does not take factors such as muscle mass into account; certain people such as athletes may have a high BMI even without having a high body fat percentage since muscle weighs more than fat. If you believe you fall into this category of people and may be at risk of being denied for surrogacy, please start the process by completing this form and we will look forward to talking with you more about your individual circumstances. BMI may also not be representative of obesity-related health risks with children, whose growth goes hand-in-hand with varying amounts of body fat at different stages of physical development. Most of the general population doesn’t fall into these categories, though, and knowing your BMI can be a powerful and informative tool to assess your risk for obesity-related health concerns. How to Calculate BMI The only pieces of information you need to calculate your BMI are your height (in inches) and weight (in pounds) – and maybe a calculator. The formula is simple: BMI= (703 x weight in pounds)/(height in inches x height in inches) For a person weighing 130 pounds and measuring 5 feet 6 inches in height, the calculation would look like this: BMI= (703 X 130)/(66 X 66)= (91,390)/(4,356)= 20.98 There are also resources available online to calculate your BMI without reliving your seventh-grade math class, like this BMI Calculator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What Can Your BMI Indicate? If you are considering surrogacy, it is key to keep in mind the associated health concerns of a high BMI while pregnant. There is a greater risk of gestational diabetes, for example, which means a higher chance of stress on the surrogate’s kidneys. Adult diabetes is even linked to being carried by a woman with gestational diabetes. BMI may not be the only component of a healthy person or a healthy pregnancy, but at ConceiveAbilities we know it’s a crucial step when partnering with you to consider whether a surrogacy journey is a good option for you. Regardless of where your BMI falls, it can help as a starting point to determine your current health needs, risks, and goals. If your BMI falls below 18.5, it may be an indicator that your body is not absorbing enough nutrients or that you are not eating enough calories to keep up with your lifestyle. Alternately, if your BMI is consistently within the range to be considered obese with no outlying factors, it can be a helpful guiding force to speak with your doctor or dietician about how to best meet your body’s health needs. What Do I Do If My BMI Is High? Reaching a BMI within the requirements is attainable. The CDC’s guide for healthy weight loss outlines getting started, improving healthy eating habits and keeping the weight off. You may also consider finding a nutrition expert or personal trainer. There are also many fitness apps that can guide your fitness efforts. Other Requirements to be a Surrogate 95% of our surrogates achieve medical clearance from fertility clinics. Our surrogate requirements include: Having given birth to at least one child Being at least 21 years old and not older than 43 Being a citizen or long-term resident of the United States Watch Dr. Angie Beltsos of Kindbody explain more about the requirements to be a surrogate. It can be overwhelming to interpret the variety of opinions on BMI. It is helpful to remember that, at its most basic level, BMI is a simple formula that uses your height and weight to determine body fat. We recognize that it is not an all-encompassing determination of your health. At ConceiveAbilities, however, it is a starting point to help us build a picture of whether being a surrogate can be a healthy and successful experience for you. Even if you think you are disqualified to become a surrogate, we encourage you to still apply. There may be ways we can work together to help you achieve your dream of being a surrogate. Calling All Surrogates And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy?

    "content": "It’s something parents-to-be dream about: those first precious days with their newborn. While it’s naturally met with a mix of excitement and trepidation, these feelings can be exacerbated in a surrogate pregnancy. Many parents wonder how to best bond with their newborn once they are finally home; as it turns out, bonding can start before the baby is born whether a surrogate is involved or not. How important is bonding with a newborn? Bonding with a newborn is crucial, for both the relationship between parent and child and for the child’s overall development. According to Dr. Mary Beth Steinfeld, “When a caregiver consistently responds to an infant’s needs, a trusting relationship and lifelong attachment develops. This sets the stage for the growing child to enter healthy relationships with other people throughout life and to appropriately experience and express a full range of emotions.” That said, bonding doesn’t always happen right away. And that’s okay too. Research now shows that bonding can take place over time. Consider situations where babies must be separated due to medical reasons, or families who adopt. Parents are still able to create healthy, lasting bonds with their children. “Bonding is truly an individual experience,” says Edward Chistophersen, a pediatric psychologist, “and it’s just as reasonable to expect the bond to develop over a period of time as it is for it to develop instantaneously.” Is bonding possible while the surrogate mother is pregnant? Absolutely! In fact, pregnancy is a key time to start the bonding process regardless of whether a surrogate is involved. A major myth about surrogacy is that it will prevent you from connecting with your child. You can still bond with your baby during a surrogate pregnancy, it just takes a little creativity. Some parents set up an email account for their baby-to-be; not only can it be used by the child when they’re older, but it’s a special way to share thoughts and emotions that are sometimes most easily expressed through writing. You can include photos, videos, and even invite other family members to contribute. It can truly act as a family bonding experience – not to mention a built-in time capsule. Another great way to bond is through your baby’s sense of hearing. A fetus can hear sounds from inside the womb by about 24 weeks; consider utilizing Belly Buds, which allow parents to record messages for the surrogate to play back through tiny speakers. You can include favorite songs or even read a children’s book for baby; regular exposure to your voice will make it a familiar – and fast favorite – sound once he or she is born. Talk to your surrogate about how to best incorporate this into her daily routine. The birth itself, of course, can be a major bonding experience too. Intended parents are typically right there for the entire process and are recommended to have skin-to-skin contact with their baby immediately after birth. Work closely with your gestational carrier and surrogacy team to create a birth plan that meets everyone’s needs as closely as possible. How do parent-surrogate relationships work? So how exactly do you talk to your surrogate about your hopes for the pregnancy and birth? Exactly what can you expect? The truth is that every relationship between an intended parent and surrogate is different – in fact, it’s why ConceiveAbilities prioritizes our specialized Matching Matters® process. It’s so good that it results in a 97% match at first meeting. But that’s only the start of the partnership between you and your gestational carrier. In order to have a successful surrogacy arrangement, it’s important to work together with your team – your agency, clinic, and attorney – to ensure everyone’s needs are heard and met. A reputable agency like ConceiveAbilities has the experience to guide you through the unique challenges of surrogacy, and we’re adept at handling any ups and downs you may encounter along the way. We understand and respect that each surrogacy relationship is unique, and we treat it as such. At some point after the birth, it’s recommended that your baby and surrogate have a few minutes together. Doing this allows the baby to confirm his or her senses, particularly smell. The reality is that this is what a newborn has known for the past nine months, and while they will make the transition back to mom or dad, respecting this natural instinct can only help baby adjust to life on the outside. Be sure to discuss what this might look like with your surrogate; talk about what she’s comfortable with and be sure to check in with her after the birth too to see when and if she’s ready to hold the baby. When should you start preparing emotionally? On some level, you start preparation the moment you decide you want to have a baby. For some, bonding starts during pregnancy. This is not always the case, and that’s okay. Do the best you can to mentally prepare yourself for the impending change. There is a vulnerability that comes with being a new parent; you will find yourself in new situations with someone you’re just getting to know, and it can be challenging, frustrating and scary. The learning curve of parenthood is inevitable, but bonding with your child is an important part of that. And while the emotional preparation looks a bit different in a surrogate pregnancy, of course, that doesn’t change the ultimate bond you’ll have with your child. Advice to bonding with your newborn While the bonding process will look different for each family, there are a few things you can do consistently to help guide the process and ease into this new life together. Talk to your baby. Whether it’s describing how you’re preparing baby’s bottle, your lunch, or what’s going on outside your window, newborns benefit immensely from your communication. Sounds and words are all being quickly filed away into your baby’s brain – truly a little sponge – and become their basis for speech. Have plenty of face time. If you can be face to face with your baby while you’re chatting, even better. Look into his or her eyes. Babies learn these exchanges by example – if you smile, baby will eventually return it. And that first smile is something all parents look forward to! Get skin-to-skin. Don’t underestimate the importance of touch. Skin-to-skin contact has been proven to stimulate a chemical reaction in the body through the release of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that creates bonding. Make time for snuggles, knowing that every little touch builds your baby’s sense of security and trust. Sometimes, bonding with your newborn is a challenge. If, after several weeks, you still feel unable to connect with your child, or are experiencing other symptoms like extreme sadness or hopelessness, anger, or wanting to avoid your baby or other family and friends, talk to a trusted healthcare provider. It is possible you’re dealing with Postpartum Depression (PPD). There are many resources available to help you cope, and some find that the best way to manage is seeking treatment with a therapist. It doesn’t make you a “bad” or “inept” parent; it means you want to do everything you can to best care for your child. New parenthood, especially on the heels of a surrogate pregnancy, requires a lot of adjustment. It’s perfectly normal to need extra support during this time, and the team at ConceiveAbilities is here for you from beginning to end.

    "content": "Let’s be honest– when most people envision starting their family, they don’t picture it involving in vitro fertilization (IVF). From a financial and emotional perspective, this route can be challenging. In fact, the only thing that might be more difficult than starting IVF is making the decision to stop. That doesn’t mean giving up on building a family, though. Far from it. What it means is that you’ll take another alternate path, one with plenty of guidance from a team of trusted professionals. While the journey certainly won’t look like what you may have once imagined, the result is the same: bringing your baby home. Understanding IVF success rates First, let’s take a look at IVF statistics. It’s important to understand how IVF success rates work. For example, how are IVF success rates obtained? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitor cycles using assisted reproductive technology (ART) with a system called the National Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance System, or NASS 2.0. Those are a lot of acronyms, but what it boils down to is that about 95% of ART cycles are reported. And due to the time and effort it takes to gather those results, statistics are typically about two to three years behind. That’s why it’s crucial to do thorough research when considering fertility clinics. Moreover, it’s important to understand the factors that make your situation unique. Diagnosis and age all have an impact on IVF success rates, and some clinics will be better suited to meet your needs than others. Reasons for a failed IVF cycle The frustrating fact is that there can be many reasons an IVF cycle is unsuccessful. A common reason is chromosomal abnormalities in the embryo; modern techniques such as preimplantation genetic testing, or PGT. help to reduce this risk by testing the embryo for general chromosomal issues. Unfortunately, however, some fertilization attempts will be unsuccessful from the start due to egg or sperm abnormalities. Without a healthy embryo to implant, a transfer will be discouraged. Other factors, such as uterine lining, general abnormalities of the reproductive system, or even medication errors make up a smaller portion of failed IVF cycles. And, just like infertility in general, some reasons are unexplained. How many IVF cycles should I have before giving up? Rather than “giving up,” try to reframe it as “going a different route.” Something important to consider is insurance. Currently, 15 states offer some degree of infertility insurance coverage. Under the Affordable Care Act, there are several different categories an insurance policy may fall under: No fertility insurance coverage Insurance Coverage for Infertility Diagnosis Insurance Coverage for Infertility Diagnosis and Limited Treatment Full Infertility Insurance Coverage Medication Coverage (which may or may not include fertility drugs) Thoroughly review the policy to determine your options. It’s also a good idea to meet with your clinic’s financial department to discuss in more detail. This can help you to decide how many cycles, if any, will have at least some coverage. Ultimately, the decision to continue is up to you and your reproductive endocrinologist. With or without insurance, only you can determine if you have the financial and emotional means to continue infertility treatment. What are your options after multiple failed IVF cycles? Considering insurance coverage at the outset makes your options much clearer in the event of a failed cycle. For example, you may have coverage for things like medication in a cycle with an egg donor or surrogate. Having this knowledge can ease some of the stress when discussing other options and may make the decision to continue a little less daunting. Egg donation is a top option to consider, especially if known chromosomal abnormalities have prevented a successful IVF cycle. If a woman is over 42 years old or has been diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, egg donation is often the recommended route. Using a donor egg still allows you to experience pregnancy and childbirth first-hand, as well as make decisions about the prenatal environment and lifestyle factors. Surrogacy is an excellent solution for women who are, for whatever reason, unable to carry a pregnancy. It’s also a highly successful option for unexplained infertility. IVF clinics in the US have a surrogacy success rate of about 75%. Once the gestational carrier is pregnant, the success rate for a healthy birth is as high as 95%. Tips on choosing an assisted conception treatment If you’re considering third party reproduction with the assistance of an egg donor or gestational carrier, don’t do it alone. The best way to set yourself up for a successful IVF cycle is to work with a reputable team. At ConceiveAbilities, we believe that our longevity and staff of experienced professionals are key ingredients in creating a family. It can be incredibly difficult to know if surrogacy or egg donation (or both) is right for you, especially if the concept is brand new. There are many factors to consider: cost, financial support, insurance, legal agreements and more. And while it may sound overwhelming, it doesn’t have to be. Allow our experts to guide you through the process from start to finish as we work toward a common goal – your baby.",

    "content": "Helping someone else build a family by donating her eggs is something that only a select few women feel called to do. And while it’s a noble gesture to even consider egg donation, not everyone will meet the stringent criteria. You might be wondering if you’ve got what it takes to be an egg donor. Here are 5 things to know about egg donor disqualifications. 1. What are all the requirements to donate your eggs? There are several primary requirements that must be met in order for you to donate eggs. Medical requirements must be met to ensure the best possible outcome, and they are non-negotiable. Between 21-28 years of age BMI under 28 Have regular monthly periods No reproductive disorders or abnormalities Physically and emotionally healthy Non-nicotine user, non-smoker, non-drug user; no vaping or psychotropic drug use Not currently on the Depo-Provera shot Not currently using the Implanon/Nexplanom arm implant In addition, a donor must be: Willing to be under consideration for 6 months Willing and able to respond to communication within 24 hours 2. What disqualifies you from donating eggs? A number of factors are taken into consideration when a candidate submits an egg donor application. As mentioned previously, age is important. If a candidate is much older or younger than the required age range, she is more likely to yield poor quality, or aneuploid, eggs. These eggs have an abnormal number of chromosomes and cannot develop into viable embryos. Other key factors that disqualify you from donating eggs are medical and mental health history. While no one’s family health history is completely clean, certain diseases and disorders will prevent an applicant from moving forward. Genetic testing during the medical workup can uncover such conditions. While it’s always disappointing when a cycle is cancelled, it is also important information for the donor to have. Something else to keep in mind? Your level of commitment. Due to the time sensitive nature of egg donation, donors must be responsible, communicative and respectful of appointments and schedules. Consider your ability to make the donor cycle a priority; unresponsiveness is one of the most common egg donor disqualifications. 3. Is contraception important? Yes! Contraception is crucial, in fact, both to the success of the donor cycle and for your own safety. Applicants are asked what kind of contraception they are using. This is important for a number of reasons. Donor candidates using a method of contraception that does not allow for regular monthly menstruation are ineligible. Certain pills, IUDs and implants alter hormones, which can have a negative impact on the cycle. Without a regular period, it is also not possible to track and sync with the intended mother or gestational carrier prior to the retrieval. A candidate who is not currently on birth control will be instructed to take it during the donor process. Donors who are not using contraception (or are having unprotected sex) are at a higher risk of sexually transmitted diseases. STD testing is part of a donor’s medical workup, and it is critical that she remain STD free for the duration of her participation in the program. While taking the required injectable medications prior to retrieval, a donor is extremely fertile. The medication induces a larger number of follicles than the body would normally produce, which means that the risk of pregnancy is much higher. To prevent this, donors must abstain from intercourse during the medication phase of the process until she gets her next period after the egg retrieval. 4. Are financial factors considered? While a donor applicant’s personal financial situation has no bearing on her ability to become an egg donor, there are a few things to keep in mind. Donors may be responsible for IUD removal if one is implanted. They are responsible for providing results from a current pap smear (within the last 12 months) as well as local transportation to and from appointments. There are no other financial expectations of the donor; all testing, medication and travel costs will be covered or reimbursed. 5. Is it possible to reapply to be an egg donor? It depends. If there were certain circumstances (such as availability or method of birth control) that caused your application to be rejected, you may be considered down the line. Other factors, such as family medical history or an unsuccessful egg donation cycle, would make a donor ineligible to reapply. If you are a previous donor who receives approval from the fertility clinic to donate again, you can certainly reapply! Here at ConceiveAbilities, we are looking for women who are healthy, open and ready to commit to helping create a family. If you meet that criteria and are ready to give the gift of a lifetime, we would love to meet you! Contact our egg donor team to take the next step.",

    "content": "ConceiveAbilities is proud to serve the LGBTQ community. We have helped many gay men become parents through surrogacy and have many resources for hopeful gay dads to learn more about the surrogacy process. Recently, new dads Kyle and Randy shared their surrogacy journey and why ConceiveAbilities was right for them. You can also listen to our surrogacy podcasts with Joseph Tito on his surrogacy journey to parenthood with as a single gay man and with New York Fertility Expert Dr. Joshua Stewart sharing his surrogacy journey with his husband. As gestational surrogacy becomes an ever more popular means of family building for gay men, the modern decision of whose sperm should be used in the fertilization process remains an early psychological stumbling block for many couples. It doesn’t have to be this way. Through direct and open communication, input from your fertility doctor, as well as consideration of a few other key variables, the decision to use yours, his, or both, can be made without any undue stress or anxiety. Direct & Open Communication As adults in a committed and loving relationship you and your husband or partner, are likely experienced at navigating potentially tricky topics together. That said, parenthood and even the prospect of it can sometimes inspire primal and unexpectedly strong emotions. Licensed Mental Health Professional, Alicia Denefe, MBA, M.S., LCPC, suggests that couples addressing this issue, “commit to receiving one another’s input as graciously as possible, while honestly advocating for themselves and their preferences.” Alicia further encourages “to take the time to sit down and address the issue from all sides. Both parties should share their fears, hesitations, and concerns. Try not to shy away from potentially awkward or especially emotional aspects of the issue. Discussing this openly and honestly is the only way to come to a true consensus”. This open dialog should ideally occur well in advance of any fertility procedures. Walking into your fertility clinic with a plan to “wing it” or “call an audible” is not encouraged. Input from your Fertility Doctor Just as important as open communication is informed direction from your fertility doctor. If you are ready to take the next steps, both you and your partner should make appointments with a reputable fertility clinic for a workup. The good news is that male fertility testing is generally noninvasive and will likely only include the taking of family history, a short physical exam, as well as a semen analysis that considers sperm count, morphology, and motility. Input from your fertility doctor after this analysis may make for an easy decision. Looking for a fertility clinic and not certain where to start? Check out the Center For Disease Control and Prevention’s interactive map. Not only will you find providers near you but you can also access their rates of success. Talking Traits This can be an area of deep discussion and reflection. If either you or your partner is endowed with an extraordinary gift (e.g. are an exceptional athlete, a genius, or a musical savant), or possess a trait treasured in your family (such as curly hair or generous height), you may want to include this in your decision-making. The same holds if a trait runs in the family that you do not want to pass on, such as a gene for a heritable disease. Your use of gestational surrogacy and egg donation warrant these inheritable traits be considered. We recommend that you include them in your early discussions and we encourage you to reach out for the guidance of a licensed mental health professional if you feel overwhelmed about approaching the subject. Both: Concurrent or Siblings Before further discussion of whose sperm to use, it is worth making clear that “both” is an option. Speak with your fertility doctor and surrogacy agency about arranging for a concurrent journey or a sibling journey with your respective genetics, so that both you and your partner may have a genetic link with your children. Purposefully Unknown Sperm Source: Not Recommended The combining of both partner’s sperm and the fertilization of the egg without knowledge of which father’s genetics was used is not recommended by most medical professionals. Although this method seems to be popular in fictional media, it is not a good idea. It is best for children to be aware of their genetic history for future medical benefits. Besides, a simple at-home DNA test would quickly dissolve any engineered biological uncertainty. Not to mention, such behavior may also needlessly complicate legal processes. This option is simply not worth the trouble. Simple Genetic Panel Although not entirely foolproof, and certainly not standard protocol, a simple genetic panel or even a more complete, expanded screening, one which tests for flawed genes relating to more than 400 other disorders may provide valuable insights, peace of mind, and maybe worth including in your early steps, especially if there are any reasons for concern. There are now more options for reproductive testing than ever before. Interplay of Egg Donor As a gay couple, you will likely be using a donor egg but perhaps a close female friend or a relative has offered to donate her eggs. In instances in which your known donor is a relative, the choice of the non-related father as the provider of sperm is obvious. In the less obvious situation of a close friend acting as your egg donor, parties would be wise to consider the potential interpersonal realities of each decision. Conclusion With guidance from your informed fertility doctor, analysis of a full genetic panel, and through the means of open and honest communication and an open mind, your partner and yourself will find the path that is right for your family. No matter how big this decision may seem now, chances are that you will look back and find it to be relatively insignificant. Your child(ren) will be your shared child(ren), no matter whose sperm is used. The incredible bond between a parent and a child has far less to do with genetics and so much more to do with the love, care, and time that is invested in the relationship. Do not worry. You will make the right choice no matter what you choose. Learn more ConceiveAbilites’ surrogacy program by visiting unique needs of same-sex fathers throughout the surrogacy by visiting our website.

    "content": "Taking care of yourself and your health is so important when you’re starting a family. No matter what path to parenthood we take, making certain we are in the best shape we can be and addressing any of our own health concerns to either be “pregnancy ready” or “parent ready” for when we expand our family are wise investments. This is especially true if it helps us conceive! One area of focus that is helpful to look at is diet and nutrition. Vitamin D is nutrient that is sometimes overlooked but as you’ll see below, it can be an instrumental tool when it comes to reproductive health, feeling good in general, pregnancy and many various aspects of our physical wellbeing. Let’s review why making sure you’re getting enough D in your diet makes sense. What benefits does Vitamin D have? Vitamin D is needed for general health and to maintain strong bones. It regulates the calcium in your blood, bones and supports your muscles and allows the brain and body to communicate with one another through your nerves. It also aids in your immune system to fight off bacteria and viruses. Vitamin D also can help in conceiving but be essential in having a healthy pregnancy. Not having the vitamin D you need can also negatively impact a pregnancy. It can increase your risk of anemia, pre-eclampsia which can result in an emergency caesarean birth. The March of Dimes even lists vitamin D as one of its top six nutrients to assist with a baby’s growth and development during your pregnancy by giving him or her what it needs for its bones and teeth to develop. Where can I find it? Ideally, everyone would soak up their vitamin D from the sun but that depends not only on where you live but what season it is. Vitamin d can be found in some foods like liver, fortified breakfast cereals, margarine, cheese, and egg yolks but it can also be taken in supplement form. However, you should not take any vitamins without speaking to your doctor and getting the exact recommended amount. Symptoms of lack of Vitamin D If you’re someone who works or is frequently indoors, lives in a place that doesn’t get a lot of sunlight, you tend not to eat a balanced meal or a diet that doesn’t include food rich in vitamin D such as fish or dairy; you may be vitamin D deficient. Many do not get enough sun exposure to maintain a normal vitamin D level throughout the year. Few foods are naturally rich in vitamin D, so it is also difficult to get enough vitamin D from your diet. Common symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency are: Alopecia (Hair Loss) Getting sick often or easily Depression Cuts that take a while to heal Feeling tired or fatigued often Having stomach issues Back or bone pain Muscle pain How does vitamin D affect fertility? There was a study in 2012 that was called Infertility Unit of the Fondazione Ca’ Granda at Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico that discovered women with sufficient levels of vitamin D were nearly twice as likely to conceive compared with those who had decreased levels of vitamin D. Two additional studies that have also shown vitamin D is associated with higher pregnancy rates including one study that showed those with a normal vitamin D level were four times more likely to get pregnant through IVF compared to those who had a lower vitamin D levels. Does vitamin D improve egg quality? Some studies have shown that women who have lower levels of vitamin D are associated with low AMH, PCOS and uterine fibroids. Vitamin D assists in the production of the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which is the measure of a woman’s ovarian reserve. Increasing your Vitamin D intake can potentially improve your egg quality, which would help your chances of conceiving. Does vitamin D deficiency affect sperm? Vitamin D is a factor when it comes to male fertility. Research has shown that it can impact men’s testosterone levels, and, similar to a woman’s egg quality, it can impact the quality of his sperm. In a study from 2017 from European Society of Endocrinology, there was evidence that taking vitamin D supplementation could improve semen quality, fertility outcomes and could be beneficial for couples undergoing IVF. Does vitamin D3 help ovulation? In 2011, a study was presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine Annual Meeting where it was suggested that low vitamin D levels may negatively affect ovulation. This study was done by Yale University researcher Dr. Lubna Pal. They did a small study involving approximately 67 women with problems ovulating and they found what they felt to be a significant link between low vitamin D and an ovulation issue. There have also been some studies done around PCOS, which can cause ovulation issues and whether it’s linked to low levels of vitamin D concerns. Overall, there doesn’t seem to be anything completely conclusive in this area so it’s best you speak to your doctor on what he or she recommends. Vitamin D and unexplained infertility Infertility is a medical condition that affects your reproductive system and can prevent the ability of conceiving. “Unexplained Infertility” is when there is no clear cause of infertility can be determined. When it’s unclear what your diagnosis is, you and your doctor should discuss several options. Since, as you can see, there have been numerous studies showing that vitamin D can not only impact both male and female fertility, it’s worth looking at you and your partner’s blood work to take a look at whether you may vitamin D deficiency. If so, it may be worth trying in correlation with fertility treatment to see if it can help. In addition to all of the studies we’ve mentioned, according to the University of Birmingham in 2017, British researchers found that women with typical levels of vitamin D were 34 percent more likely to have a positive pregnancy test and approximately 46 percent more likely to achieve a clinical pregnancy and a third more likely to have a live birth than women with low levels of vitamin D. Again, when you can’t find a diagnosis, looking at every angle and trying different things may help increase your chances whether you’re trying to conceive naturally or pursuing IVF. Whether you feel you may be vitamin D deficient or not, speaking to a reproductive endocrinologist about your fertility concerns and general health is always a good idea.

    "content": "There is a great deal of selflessness that comes with the beautiful act of surrogacy. Both the intended parent(s) and the gestational carrier’s sacrifice, all for the purpose of bringing a life into this world. Once a surrogacy partnership has been established, meaning you have been matched, each party will need to determine the type of surrogacy agreement that best fits their unique situation. There are also different types of surrogacy agreements. One is referred to as a commercial surrogacy agreement, also known as “compensated” surrogacy and the other is referred to as altruistic surrogacy which is commonly called a “compassionate” surrogacy. With any major decisions, there are both pros and cons associated with each option. Below, we will dive into the pros and cons of altruistic surrogacy. What is Altruistic Surrogacy? According to our good friends at Merriam Webster, someone who is altruistic is defined as: “an unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others.” We can all agree here that it takes someone who is extremely unselfish to consider surrogacy, no matter if it is a commercial or altruistic agreement. In an altruistic surrogacy, a woman will carry a child as a great act of generosity, by waving financial compensation known as a “surrogacy fee” apart from the medical, legal, and other various pregnancy expenses that naturally occur in the process of surrogacy. What are the pros to altruistic surrogacy? Cost. It’s no hidden secret that surrogacy can be cost prohibitive especially for those couples and individuals who have already invested in years of fertility treatments prior to considering surrogacy. In a commercial surrogacy arrangement, the surrogate would receive compensation not only for the costs associated with carrying the pregnancy but also for her time and effort. While cost is an obvious pro, it is one of the biggest reasons why altruistic or low-comp surrogacy is considered and why some people overlook the risk factors that may be connected. Familiarity. Often, an “independent” or altruistic surrogate enters into a surrogacy because she personally knows the individual or couple, such as a close family member or friend, and is genuinely wanting to help them. Although entering into an altruistic surrogacy with someone you know, can also come with its own set of problems, it’s a beautiful gesture of kindness. It is also the basis for why most surrogates consider surrogacy – no matter if the agreement is compensated or not. Intended parents also may feel an increased level of comfort and trust since a relationship has already been previously established. Accessibility. Compensated surrogacy is illegal in some U.S. states and in several countries. For example, Australia and Canada only allow altruistic surrogacy arrangements. In these situations where the intended parent lives in a non-surrogacy friendly state or country, altruistic agreements may be the only option that intended parents have. What are the cons to altruistic surrogacy? Relationships. In an altruistic agreement, you risk your relationship being strained over the course of the process and post birth. Surrogacy can be complicated and full of shared demands. While the intended parents endure the financial and emotional aspects, the surrogate is also going through a great deal physically and emotionally. Intended parents may withhold basic requests essential to the surrogacy since they are not compensating the surrogate, and in return, the surrogate may not feel comfortable asking her friend or family member for reimbursement of minor items and basic requests which will add up over time. You’ll have to ask yourself, can this relationship withstand a surrogacy, and is it worth the risk of the relationship. Less Safe-Guards. Using a reputable agency in a compensated surrogacy agreement will help navigate both the intended parents and the surrogate through the complex process. No stone is unturned, and there are protective measures that are put into place to protect both parties- such as background checks, psychological screening, and confirming financial stability. There is no third-party objective in an altruistic surrogacy agreement to help safe-guard potential risks. Cost. This can also be a con for several reasons. If this was the case for a commercial surrogacy agreement, intended parents and the gestational carrier would typically need to prove financial stability to enter into a surrogacy program with an agency. At the end of the day, the intended parent(s) need to be able to support the medical and various costs that accompany the surrogacy process, and the surrogate would need to prove that they are not doing it as a primary source of income. In the case of an altruistic agreement, the gestational carrier could incur more out of pocket costs, and the intended parents could also end up paying more due to misinformation or other various outliers. Why should gestational carriers be compensated? Undergoing a surrogacy is a great commitment. There are many first-time surrogates that may enter into an altruistic agreement, not fully aware what the emotional and physical role it will play in their day to day lives. The surrogate will need to attend a greater number of appointments, especially at the beginning stages of the process. There is also a significant impact on her family as they will be the ones who are supporting her on a daily basis. You’ll want your gestational carrier to feel appreciated for the level of sacrifice she is committing to. Compensation allows her to feel appreciated and recognized for her time and effort in helping you grow your family. What are the legal aspects of an altruistic surrogacy? The legal process is relatively the same whether you consider to move forward with a commercial or altruistic surrogacy agreement. The intricate details must still be laid out in a gestational surrogacy agreement also known as a GSA, which is a legal contract that will bind the two parties throughout the surrogacy process. The difference is that in an altruistic GSA, there are no pre-negotiated financial details in regards to a surrogacy/base fee. While an altruistic surrogacy, like any surrogacy agreement, is a beautiful gesture of kindness, it does come with risk. Every situation is unique and where some altruistic surrogacy experiences may be picturesque, for others, the risk may far outweigh the positive aspects of it. Whichever route you consider, be sure to consult with an experienced reproductive attorney and professional to help you decide if this is the right path for you.

    "content": "On the path to parenthood, there can be many factors that may prevent you from getting pregnant as quickly as you had planned or hoped. One possible diagnosis is tubal factor infertility which affects approximately 20 to 25% of couples who are experiencing infertility. This includes cases where a woman’s fallopian tubes are completely blocked, or she has either one blocked tube and/or no blockage but some sort of damage or scarring that is preventing her and her partner from conceiving. In this blog, we’ll delve into this condition, exactly what it is, how it does and doesn’t impact your fertility and the options you can explore so you can expand your family. What is Tubal Factor Infertility? In a typical “trying to conceive” cycle, the ovary releases an egg into the fallopian tube where it would wait to be fertilized with sperm. The fertilized egg, the embryo, would then travel to the uterus and attach itself to the uterine lining (also known as implantation). This would mean you are pregnant. Since tubal factor infertility is when a woman’s Fallopian tube(s) are compromised either through scarring, damage or blockage, it can block a clear pathway in two ways: For the sperm to reach the egg in order to fertilize it. If the egg is able to be fertilized and an embryo is created, it may not be able to reach the uterus so that it can properly implant. What causes your fallopian tubes to be blocked? There are various potential causes of tubal factor infertility but the most common are the following: Previous abdominal surgery Ruptured appendix Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection of the female reproductive organs Endometriosis, a disease in which the tissue that normally lines the uterus is found outside the uterus Sexually transmitted disease (STD), such as gonorrhea and/or chlamydia Ectopic pregnancies previously, which is when the embryo grows outside of the uterus What are the signs and symptoms of blocked fallopian tubes? Unless you have a had a tubal ligation, where you electively decided to have your “tubes-tied”, many women do not necessarily realize that there is an issue with their fallopian tubes until they begin actively trying to conceive. However, if you’ve had any of the above, such as endometriosis or PID, you may have experienced painful cramps or lower abdominal pain. There are two tests recommended to diagnose blocked fallopian tubes and they are: Hysterosalpingogram (HSG): This is a form of an X-ray that uses a dye that is gently passed through the cervix and into the fallopian tubes to see if they are blocked. This test is just one piece of the puzzle. If the HSG shows that your tubes appear to be opening, there may still be blockage or scarring within the lining of the tube. Laparoscopy: This is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that gives your doctor a more direct view of the fallopian tubes. While the HSG provides an X-ray, the laparoscope can give your doctor additional insight into whether the tubes are blocked or if there are other issues such as scar tissue or adhesions. Can you still ovulate if your fallopian tubes are blocked? What’s encouraging is while your fallopian tubes may or may not have an issue, this does not impact the actual act of ovulation. The concern is more that if you regularly ovulate monthly, and you have blocked tubes, your egg and the sperm may not be able to meet for fertilization to happen. This doesn’t mean that you’re not ovulating or that there is an ovulation problem. If, however, you’re having irregular periods or have been using ovulation prediction kits or some other form of trying to pinpoint your ovulation time such as a BBT Thermometer and are having difficulty finding your most fertile period, you may want to mention this to the doctor. Can you be a surrogate after tubal ligation? Yes! It could actually mean you’re a great candidate for surrogacy; you have proven fertility and are most likely done building your own family, both of which are important qualities for a gestational carrier. Plus – and this is also a critical point – it’s extremely unlikely you’ll become pregnant on your own before the embryo transfer. Because the egg will be from the intended mother or an egg donor, your ovaries and fallopian tubes will not be involved in the process at all. Is IVF Successful with Blocked Fallopian Tubes? When trying to conceive, you have various treatment options and you should feel comfortable reviewing them with your doctor to decide which works best for you. For example, in vitro fertilization (IVF) is an ideal option. It’s the process of when eggs are retrieved from the woman, then mixed with sperm from her husband, partner or male donor in a laboratory and then any resulting embryo(s) are transferred to the woman’s uterus. This is considered an ideal option to tubal factor infertility because it completely bypasses the fallopian tubes. It’s important to note that age is a factor with IVF even in cases of tubal factor infertility. Speak to your doctor about the success rates for your age group and if he or she recommends this as an option. Treatment of Tubal Factor Infertility If your doctor does not recommend IVF or you’re not ready to pursue fertility treatment, there are some other options to potentially repair your fallopian tubes. They are: Tubal Cannulation: This is an outpatient procedure and uses a catheter and balloon to gently unblock your tubes. Fimbrioplasty: This is a laparoscopic procedure that aims to rebuild the “fimbriae”, which describes the finger-like ends of your fallopian tube to sew them back together. This is recommended for those who have only minor blockage. Salpingectomy: This is the surgical removal of a damaged fallopian tube. When you want to have a family, you don’t want any roadblocks standing in your way. Still, what is comforting when it comes to tubal factor infertility is you have several options to choose from that can help create alternative pathways for your eggs and embryos to get to where they need to be. Speak to your doctor, talk to your partner, and contact us so we can help you talk through all of your family building options to bring you one step closer to becoming the parent you aim to be.",

    "content": "Pregnancy is an exciting time where you feel the baby grow, kick, stretch, and move around. In the final month of pregnancy, as the baby gets bigger, he or she will have less wiggle room and their position in the womb can become incredibly important. Your doctor will be monitoring this at each appointment and will keep you updated. But we’d still like to provide you with an overview of what each position means, where the baby should be as delivery approaches, and what is the ideal position for labor. For now, feel free to get in whatever position you’re most comfortable in as we review! What Positions Do Babies Lie in the Womb? There are various positions that babies can be in when they are in the womb. They also can move, shift and change throughout the pregnancy but below are the most common. They are: Transverse Lie If the baby is lying horizontally, laying on it’s side in the uterus, it’s considered in a transverse position. This position can carry certain risks should the baby not move to a different position before labor as it can cause issues with the umbilical cord and overall delivery. There are options such as trying to gently rotate the baby manually, or if necessary, a c-section may be required at the time of birth. Breech There are various forms of breech positions (footling, frank and complete), but the general position is that the baby’s feet or butt are pointing towards the birth canal and the head is still facing up. Each of these positions are not recommended and can cause concerns with delivery, the umbilical cord, and safety to both the mother and baby. As with the transverse lie position, if the baby can’t be moved or does not move on its own, a c-section will most likely be performed. The Head Down Position The “head down position” is the ideal position but even within this category, there are different ways the baby may be facing: Anterior Position (Also known as the “Cephalic Presentation”): This is when the baby’s chin is tucked into the chest, with their face essentially facing the back. The head points directly towards the birthing canal, which is incredibly helpful. Posterior Position: This position is very similar to the above but in this case, the baby is facing head down, towards the stomach. This is also called the “face-up position” since the baby’s face would be seen first when delivering. While many babies in this position do turn to the anterior position before delivery, if they stay in this position, it may cause some complications and may even lead to a c-section. What Baby Position is Best for Delivery? In most pregnancies, the hope is that the baby is in the anterior, head down position for delivery and this typically happens around 32 to 36 weeks. In a very small percentage of cases, some babies wait until just before delivering to go into this position. The reason this makes for the optimal position is when the baby is in a head down, with the assistance of a little weight and gravity, it puts pressure on the cervix which widens it. This guides the baby’s head to smoothly slip under the pubic bone for an easier delivery. Overall, having the baby being head down tends to reduce the risk of complications during childbirth. Your doctor will be able to tell if the baby is in this position through checking your belly and a performing an ultrasound. You may be able to tell where the baby is if you feel kicks higher up or hiccups or flutters that are usually caused by their hands or even hiccups further below. If you’re close to delivering and the baby is not in the head down position, ask your doctor if they have specific recommendations to help the baby turn. There are suggestions such as taking a daily walk, sitting on an exercise ball to stimulate the pelvis and encourage the baby to turn, as well as avoiding putting your feet up when lying down. Your doctor will be able to give you recommendations specific to your case. What You Can and Can’t Control Remember, you do have a doctor and medical team taking care of you and monitoring you and the baby. There’s very little you can do to control where the baby is at all times so it’s best to relax, stay positive and follow doctor’s orders. If there are any concerns about the baby’s position the closer you get come delivery time, there are options that will be discussed and explored. And as always, should you have any concerns, feel free to talk to your doctor or our team at ConceiveAbilities if we can help in any way.",

    "content": "Before signing the dotted line on your surrogacy agreement, it’s important to take a deep dive into all of the factors and outliers to consider before entering into a surrogacy arrangement. Spoiler alert: It’s a lot. The good news is we have it broken down for you here. Let’s begin! Are you emotionally prepared for surrogacy? Building a family through surrogacy is equal parts beautiful and emotionally challenging. Whatever your reasons for pursuing surrogacy, many unexpected feelings can surface. Just how most gestational carriers undergo psychological screening to ensure they are psychologically sound to withstand the potential emotional challenges of surrogacy, the intended parent(s) need to be sure they are also in a good head space prior to entering into a surrogacy arrangement. Ask yourself these questions: Have you fully come to terms with your need to pursue surrogacy? Years of infertility or the inability to build a family due to sexual preference can bring on a certain amount of mental baggage. Giving yourself time to mourn the loss of the ability to carry a pregnancy of your own will help you be in a better, more positive mindset to not only support your gestational carrier through the pregnancy, but it will also help you fully embrace the surrogacy process to its fullest. Can you explain surrogacy to friends and family? Compared to over a decade ago, surrogacy is becoming more of an available option. Even though there is a growing awareness of this incredible life-giving option, you may encounter some initial questions. People are curious by nature, especially those who are close to you. It’s best to be in a place where you can be honest, and have a pocket response prepared as to why surrogacy was the best decision for you. We also recommend these tips on how to explain surrogacy to your family and friends. Do you have a good support network to help you through the surrogacy process? Support from your partner, friends and family is key in helping provide a solid foundation of emotional support. Surrogacy can be taxing both physically and mentally on your gestational carrier. It can also bring about both financial and emotional challenges to the intended parent(s). Surrogacy extends to your partner and can radiate out to your family no matter if you are an intended parent or a gestational carrier. By explaining how surrogacy works and especially what you need from your loved ones to support you through it, will truly help you have a less stressful and more enjoyable experience. Do you have enough time for the surrogacy process? There are many factors that can greatly impact the amount of time you will need to invest into the surrogacy process. Some factors that affect time include, but are not limited to, the dynamics of both travel and medical treatments. Travel: Ultimately, it starts with determining which surrogacy program you will consider. Although both domestic surrogacy and international surrogacy can have some lengthy travel attached to it, international surrogacy programs will require the most, being that you will need to take time to travel abroad to another country. More than likely, travel will be required a few times over the course of the pregnancy and birth. Even in a domestic surrogacy, many surrogacy arrangements are made across state lines which would also require travel and missed time from your work and day to day life. Medical: There are two parts to this. If the intended parent(s) will be undergoing fertility treatment to produce an embryo for a gestational surrogacy arrangement, then the In Vitro Fertilization, or IVF, process can be rather life consuming. Albeit temporary, it will still require a great investment of time. Another factor to consider is how much time you will have to contribute to the pregnancy process. This will obviously depend on many factors, as well as determining how involved in the pregnancy you will want to be. If you want to take on an active role in the pregnancy, then you’ll need to account for missed work to attend the number of prenatal care appointments that accompany standard pregnancy. If there are unforeseen complications then you can expect to spend more time away. Are you ready for parenthood? This may seem like a ridiculous question to ask yourself, but it’s on our list for a reason. The gift of a child through surrogacy is one that is immeasurable. Just getting to this point, of even considering it, means that you and your partner have likely had long discussions on planning future family building. It is important that you and your partner are unequivocally on the same page of wanting to pursue parenthood. Once your surrogate/gestational carrier is pregnant, fully understanding that this is your baby and that you will need to be ready physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially for your baby when his or her due date arrives. Can you afford surrogacy? Family building through reproductive treatment and, in this case surrogacy, comes with an associated cost. There are many factors that can influence cost such as legal fees, donor and surrogate matching, travel expenses, agency fees, pregnancy expenses and medical costs, just to name a few. A knowledgeable surrogacy agency can walk you through what to expect in terms of cost, as well as ways to make surrogacy more affordable. At the end of the day, you need to put your pen to paper and determine if this is the right family building option for you and your budget. Understanding surrogacy law This will also depend on the type of surrogacy program you consider. If you decide to pursue a domestic surrogacy arrangement, surrogacy laws often vary from state to state. And, depending on the state, they could have restrictions or even ban compensation to your surrogate. Although the U.S. is fairly regulated and much less complicated than other countries abroad, you will need to have a clear understanding of surrogacy law in the state that your gestational carrier or surrogate resides. If you plan on going overseas for a surrogacy arrangement, you’ll need to know what laws are in play for that particular country. In some countries, surrogacy is banned to foreign intended parents. This is why it is extremely important to hire an attorney that is well versed in reproductive law, specifically adoption and surrogacy law. There are many things to think through when you are considering surrogacy as a way to grow your family. It also may feel overwhelming at first. If you are reading this, then you should feel confident that you are already a step ahead in the game. Being informed and knowing what is in front of you will only make this process easier.

    "content": "When you first decided to have a family, you may not have envisioned needing the help of a doctor. However, if you’ve received a diagnosis that has impacted your fertility or if you’re in a same-sex relationship, the good news is you have many paths to parenthood that you can explore. In this blog, we’re going to look at two options in particular: donor eggs and adoption. There are similarities and differences to each, pros and cons, varying timelines and many aspects to consider with each option. Below we will provide you with a high-level overview so you can decide which one is best for you, your partner, and your family building goals. Pros of egg donation There are many reasons someone may pursue egg donation. If a woman is over the age of 42 years old, has been diagnosed with premature ovarian failure (POF) or diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), or if you’re in a same-sex male couple, using donor eggs can help you have a child. Below is a list of some of the pros to using an egg donor: As a woman: You will be able to experience pregnancy first-hand. You will be able to control the lifestyle aspects during the pregnancy while the baby develops (adoption would not provide this option). If you have a male-partner and his sperm is used, the child is biologically his which you both may prefer. You will be able to experience childbirth. You will be able to experience breastfeeding, which can be a lovely and beautiful time to bond with your baby. As a same-sex male couple, using an egg donor means one of you can be genetically tied to the child if either of you choose to be the sperm source. Cons of egg donation Some women are not always comfortable with not being genetically related to her child. That is something you would need to consider for yourself. Depending on your criteria, ethnic background, etc., it may be difficult to find the match you are looking for, making the process longer than you would hope. You might not get pregnant the first time, so you need to be aware that just because you’re using “healthy” eggs, it can still take time and money. Depending which route you take (using a donor egg bank, a fresh donor or a shared donor), you should consider the potential costs involved. More on this in the cost section below! Pros of adoption While many have a wonderful experience with adoption, it can also be a long and emotional process for both you and the child you’re adopting. Below, we review some of the pros and cons to consider before embarking down the adoption journey. If you pursue a closed option, some of the pros are: The child you’re adopting will be protected from a potentially unfit birth parent. There will be a sense of closure for all involved as there will be no continued relationship with the birth family. If you pursue an open option, some of the pros are: The child will be able to have a relationship with their birth parent if either would like. The child and/or you will be able to have any answers to questions about their family background. Pros of adoption in general: Help a child and a birth mother. Neither you or your partner will feel like one has a genetic tie and the other doesn’t. Cons of adoption If you pursue a closed option, some of the cons are: Concerns that the birth mother/parents may change their mind. You’ll potentially have a limited medical history and/or limited history in general of the child you’re adopting. The child you’re adopting may have some identity issues or become preoccupied with their adoption and/or history. If you pursue an open option, some of the pros are: The birth parent and/or the child may not agree on whether they want to have a relationship. The birth parent and child may not get along with one another. The birth parent may not be in a stable, healthy environment. Potential cons of adoption in general: Adoption overall can be a long and challenging process. Some adopted children may experience emotional problems or go through issues like depression over being adopted. Depending on the situation and background of the child you are adopting, they may have medical or psychological conditions you need to ask yourself if you’re equipped and able to assist with. Timeline comparison between egg donation and adoption When pursuing either egg donation or adoption, the timeline is dependent on many varying factors, so it can be difficult to provide an exact start and finish date for either. Below are details on the estimated timeline of each process and an idea of what it entails. The egg donation timeline Once you decide you are going to use an egg donor, one of the very first steps is picking a donor. Some want the donor to have similar physical characteristics, ethnicity, religion or hobbies. It depends on the specific preferences of you and your partner. If you’re doing a fresh cycle, you would have to synchronize your menstrual cycle with your donor. If you’re using a frozen donor egg, this would not be a factor and would shorten your timeline. Another factor would be if you’re using a surrogate and an egg donor, which would also impact your timeline as well. With a fresh cycle, the eggs would be retrieved, fertilized and any resulting embryo(s) would be transferred to the intended mother or gestational carrier’s uterus. Approximately two weeks after that, a pregnancy test would be taken. The longest part of this process would most likely be the matching process of an egg donor (and surrogate if you will be using one) but the actual fertility treatment process, once that is finalized, can take anywhere from four to six weeks. The adoption timeline An adoption timeline is not as easy to breakdown because there are several paths you can take with adoption. In addition to the open and closed adoption options, there are domestic, international and foster adoption. Here are the basic steps: Choose an adoption service agency and/or provider, which can take a few months. Complete a home study and collect necessary legal documents to pursue being adoptive parents. This can also take anywhere from six to nine months. If you’re pursuing a domestic adoption, you will begin the matching process with an expectant mother. If you’re pursuing international adoption, you would need to receive a child referral, which is a needed medical document. This can take several months, up to two years. You will be matched with a child and they will be placed in your care. This can take anywhere from months to years. You will then finalize your adoption. This process can be a year or two. Overall, the adoption journey would be anywhere from a year to three years. Cost comparison between egg donation and adoption When it comes to using a donor egg, this would depend on if you’re using a fresh donor egg, a frozen donor egg or what is known as a “shared donor”. You also have to take into consideration potential donor fees, the cost of the IVF process, the embryo transfer, any prescribed medications necessary, and embryo freezing storage. Costs can range anywhere from $37,000 to $65,000, based on varying services, fees and medical expenses but again, every cycle, circumstance and clinic are different so it’s best to ask questions and get specific details before moving ahead with using a donor egg. The cost of adoption can be costly and much like using an egg donor, there are many different factors that can impact the financial amount. If you pursue using a domestic adoption, it may include costs for the birth parents. For international adoption, you would have to factor in travel costs. There are legal fees, agency fees and court costs. On average, costs can range anywhere from $15,000 to $40,000 and up depending which adoption path you take. If you’re still debating your options, we have another blog you can review called, “Surrogacy v. Adoption” but as always, we want to help support you as you review all of your family building options.

    "content": "There are many ways to build a family. Narrowing down which is the right path to parenthood can be both overwhelming and very personal. Once you have decided that surrogacy is the best fit, the decision making is far from over. The next step is figuring out which surrogacy program you’ll want to enter. Will it be an international surrogacy program or will you feel that a domestic surrogacy program is better suited for your situation? It’s a big decision. Whatever you decide, it is important to take a closer look at the pros and cons that could be involved. Including choosing an international surrogacy program. Let’s dive into what an international surrogacy looks like and unpack some of the possible risks that could take place. What is international surrogacy? The obvious difference is the logistics of geography. Simply put, the surrogacy arrangement involves a gestational carrier who lives overseas apart from the intended parents. In most international surrogacies, there may be an expectation for the intended parents to travel to the gestational carrier’s country. Increasingly, intended parents are coming from abroad to work with American gestational carriers. However, some American intended parents still choose international surrogacy over domestic surrogacy. Domestic vs International Surrogacy An international surrogacy program is starkly different from a domestic surrogacy program. In the past, international surrogacy used to be more of a common practice. Now, surrogacy has since evolved, especially in America, making it less complicated to pursue domestic surrogacy versus an international surrogacy program. Surrogacy laws, standards, and guidelines can vary extensively from country to country. Whereas in the U.S., if a particular state’s surrogacy laws and guidelines are determined “unfriendly,” it is much easier to cross over state lines than over country borders. Overall, surrogacy laws are a bit more well-regulated than what you will find overseas. Is there a difference in cost? One of the attractive reasons for American intended parents using surrogacy abroad is to be cost prohibitive. It’s no secret that surrogacy can be an expensive process no matter if you are pursuing domestic or international surrogacy. However, the saying “cheaper is not always better” stands true when it comes to the surrogacy process. Saving costs abroad also means that you will likely be paying a lesser surrogacy fee to your gestational carrier. In any compensation agreement, you always want to pay someone what they fully deserve. This is not a place to cut corners on, especially for someone that will be carrying your child for 9 months. The same mindset can be said in using an international surrogacy program outside of the U.S. for the reproductive treatment process that comes along with a gestational surrogacy. Outside of the U.S., medical requirements can be less strict, including medications that are involved. This could be a potential risk to your gestational carrier and baby. You’ll want to make sure, whether you choose domestic or international surrogacy, that the overseeing clinic has guidelines and policies in place for their surrogacy program. What are some of the hidden costs in an international surrogacy? Much of this depends on what country and international surrogacy program you decide on. Pregnancy in general can produce many outliers that can impact cost. If you decide to pursue surrogacy outside of the U.S., here are some of the areas where hidden costs may arise: Travel costs Even if you are an allstar travel planner, visiting a country abroad that you may be unfamiliar with can possibly bring forth the possibility of understated spending and travel expenses. Hotel expenses Due dates are not an exact science. So the amount of time and money you will spend on lodging is a relatively grey area. This includes the time spent on when you can legally leave the country with the approved paperwork. Medical expenses There are many variables that can happen in a pregnancy gestation. Although we’d like to think that every pregnancy and birth is without complications, they can and do exist. This is yet another area where hidden costs can surface. What are some pros and cons of international surrogacy? With so many factors involved, choosing which surrogacy program to choose can be a daunting one. Some of the things to consider can be both weighed out equally as a pro and a con. For example: Cost Pro: Although mentioned above, international surrogacy offers intended parents an affordable option. Con: It can also lead to short cuts, lack of regulations, and transparency of the process. Travel Pro: If you are traveling to the U.S. to pursue an agreement with a U.S. gestational carrier, depending on if it is a post birth or pre birth state, the process for obtaining the birth certificate and exiting the country can be much easier. Con: No matter where you are traveling abroad for your surrogacy, you will likely have to miss a fair amount of work, and navigate the logistics and laws of a foreign country. What are the risks of international surrogacy? With all major decisions, weighing the risk factors involved may help tip the scale one way or another. In an international surrogacy, there are 3 major risks to take into consideration: Legal, psychological, and financial. Legal risks Laws and guidelines vary country to country and in the U.S. state to state. Some countries have banned intended parents from overseas and some (very few) U.S. states have a ban on compensated surrogacy. You want to make sure to reduce your liability by using a reputable agency accompanied with a knowledgeable attorney. Although rare, you want to reduce your legal risk by making sure the country you decide to pursue a surrogacy agreement in is not at risk of a ban mid-way through the process. Psychological risks The psychological screening process in an international surrogacy is not enforced as it is in the U.S and domestically. While international agencies may complete medical screening, they may not complete a psychological evaluation which can be a huge risk or the intended parents. Financial risks The rose colored lense of international surrogacy is that it may appear to be less expensive. However, there is a reason why it is cheaper. You’ll most certainly risk quality but you may be cutting corners that can risk the well-being of your gestational carrier and most importantly, your baby. Why is international surrogacy law important to know? In some countries, surrogacy is banned to foreign intended parents. In other countries, the governments may not regulate surrogacy programs. Because of the lack of regulation, even if it is up to the individual states and provinces, there is a major risk of ethics and questionable practices. This is why more intended parents are coming to the U.S from abroad for surrogacy. Is there a benefit to using American gestational carriers and egg donors? In comparison, U.S. surrogacy is fairly regulated and less complicated than in other countries abroad. Gestational carriers and egg donors not only go through strict medical screening, but they also have to undergo psychological screening as well. Many U.S. fertility clinics will also require the gestational carrier’s partner to participate in some leveling degree of screening as well. Another benefit to using an American gestational carrier/egg donor is that they are compensated appropriately and engaged in the ultimate goal of a successful and healthy pregnancy and birth. It is a lot to consider and there are many reasons why someone may choose international surrogacy over domestic surrogacy. It all boils down to being informed of your options and well educated in the process.

    "content": "Infertility is defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner and is inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. In patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at six months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. It affects approximately 10 – 15% of couples throughout the United States (one in eight). This diagnosis is given to an individual or couple—depending on their age and medical history—if they have been attempting to conceive for at least a year without achieving or being able to sustain a pregnancy. In this blog, we’ll review what is referred to as, “unexplained infertility,” which is when no clear cause of infertility can be determined, which can be very frustrating. What is idiopathic infertility? When you’ve been trying to conceive for the recommended amount of time and have not been able to get pregnant, it’s recommended you see a fertility specialist for an initial consultation. For women, this would entail an ultrasound and blood work to look at hormones such as her Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), Estradiol and her Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH). If no clear cause for infertility is seen after a review of health history and these tests are done, it is idiopathic, meaning it remains unknown. It’s also important to mention that this can come up as a cause of secondary infertility. A report by the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS estimates that there are more than 3 million US women with one child that have a difficult time getting pregnant again. Even if you didn’t have any issues getting pregnant the first time, but you’re having difficulties the second time, unexplained infertility may be a factor. What are the chances of getting pregnant with unexplained infertility? What’s both good and bad about unexplained infertility is that while you can’t pinpoint what is preventing you from getting pregnant, you also have room to believe that there’s still nothing fully stopping you from conceiving. According to Oxford Academic, the overall success rate in couples with unexplained infertility is high. In fact, according to the NCBI, those who are diagnosed with unexplained infertility have a 50% chance of getting pregnant naturally within a year following diagnosis. So the odds are encouraging. How do you treat unexplained infertility? If no clear cause can be determined through initial tests, there are additional tests that can be ordered to see if they may uncover any additional information regarding yours or your partner’s fertility health. There’s a test that can be performed on a woman called a Hysterosalpingogram (HSG), which is like an x-ray of your uterus to see if it’s misshapen or if you have any uterine polyps, which could be problematic for a pregnancy. There’s also laparoscopic surgery. This can help your doctor diagnose and remove endometriosis, as well as reopen a blocked fallopian tube, amongst many other indications. Overall, if the individual or couple is looking to have children, the treatment options would most likely involve looking at fertility treatment options. How successful is IUI for unexplained infertility? Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is one fertility treatment option that can be used when you’ve been diagnosed with unexplained infertility. In terms of success rates, it can depend on your age. In general, IUI is typically the first approach when going down the path of assisted reproductive technology. It requires inserting either the male partner’s or a donor’s sperm directly into a woman’s uterus when she is ovulating. IUI is often done in conjunction with ovulation-stimulating drugs. Alternatives for conception While many don’t necessarily dream of conceiving their child through the assistance of medical intervention, when it comes to unexplained infertility, assisted reproductive technology can be incredibly helpful. In addition to the above mentioned IUI, there are common infertility treatment options you and your doctor can discuss and decide what would be the best course of action for you but some additional options are: In vitro fertilization (IVF): This is when a woman’s eggs are retrieved and combined with her partner or donor’s sperm in a laboratory. After fertilization, the resulting embryos will be transferred to the woman’s uterus. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): This is when a single sperm is injected directly into a woman’s egg, rather than placing many sperm next to the egg, as in IVF. Donor egg or embryo: If a woman is unable to conceive with her own eggs or for same sex male couples, they can have IVF treatment using eggs donated by a woman. The donor egg is combined with a partner’s sperm, and the resulting embryo is transferred to the intended mother or gestational carrier’s uterus. This procedure can also be done with a donated embryo or donated sperm. Surrogacy (gestational carrier): Another woman carries your embryo or donor embryo to term and gives birth to your baby. Not having definitive answers can be frustrating especially when you’re eager to hold a baby in your arms. What’s important to remember is that while having a family may not be in the timeline or even in the way that you had hoped, when you hold your child in your arms, how you got there won’t matter.

    "content": "If you and your partner have been trying to become pregnant without success, it can be difficult to know when it’s time to get someone else involved. Finding the right fertility clinic can seem like an overwhelming feat; depending on your location, there can be dozens of options nearby. But even if your options are more limited, how do you choose the right fertility clinic for you? We’ll explore when to visit a fertility clinic, exactly where to find one, as well as some reviews and recommendations to find the right partners to help build your family. When to visit a fertility clinic? Not getting pregnant as soon as you’re ready may seem like reason enough to visit a fertility clinic, but there are some specific criteria to consider. RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, recommends seeing a fertility specialist if you meet the following criteria: Have had more than one miscarriage Under age 35 and haven’t gotten pregnant after 12 months of trying to conceive Over age 35 and haven’t gotten pregnant after 6 months of trying to conceive Male with a poor semen analysis Up to that point, you may have been discussing your fertility with your primary care physician or gynecologist. While they may be able to give you some basic information or perform general gynecological procedures, most will refer you to a fertility expert if you meet any of the above criteria. What’s the difference between a gynecologist and a fertility expert? Well, it’s just that – a fertility expert specializes in issues related to fertility and is truly an expert in treating infertility. When it comes to having a baby, you want to be in the best possible hands. How to choose a fertility clinic? People choose a fertility clinic for a variety of reasons. For some, it may be as simple as a referral from their primary care physician or gynecologist. If you live in one of the 15 states that currently offer some degree of infertility treatment coverage, insurance parameters may impact your decision. The criteria for which you’re seeing a fertility specialist can have an impact on what clinic you choose, too. Depending on your fertility history, or what tests and procedures you’ll require, you may find that a doctor at one clinic is better suited to meet your medical needs. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) keeps a federal database of fertility clinics, which can also be a useful resource. The 1992 Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act requires the CDC to publish an annual ART Success Rates Report. Stats are several years behind (for example, current data is from 2016); while the information is not in real time, it will give a picture of a clinic’s success rates. The hard stats are a good place to start, whether or not you have personal recommendations or referrals. Cost considerations – how much will I spend? When it comes to price, fertility treatment costs can vary widely; from the type of treatment plans and options, to the number of procedures and even clinic location, it’s difficult to give a concrete number. However, RESOLVE estimates the average cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at more than $8,000. Medication can cost an additional $3,000-$5,000, and any specialized tests increase the cost from there. If you ultimately pursue third party reproduction with an egg donor or gestational surrogate, expenses increase significantly. While the price tag may feel overwhelming, there are several ways to finance fertility treatment. Insurance Health insurance is the best option, but not all states are equal when it comes to coverage. Regardless of your state’s stance on insurance for infertility, it’s worth exploring your options first. Some employers will ultimately offer fertility treatment coverage as part of the company’s insurance plan. Fertility centers Your fertility center may be able to offer assistance, too – many clinics offer financing to help manage the cost of treatment. They may also be able to connect you with pharmaceutical company programs to help with medication expenses. Loans Loan and financing programs are attainable options for many intended parents; RESOLVE offers a compendium of infertility financing programs and infertility treatment scholarships and grants to help make infertility affordable. Private loans may also be an option when financing gestational surrogacy or egg donation. CapexMD will work directly with your fertility clinic or agency as you finance your treatment. Reviews and recommendations It’s important to do your due diligence in your fertility clinic research to find the best fit – and get the best possible results. While it may seem that the most obvious choice is the clinic with the highest success rates, it doesn’t always tell the full story. Be sure the clinic is transparent with their results, and be sure you’re taking into consideration your individual situation and needs. Reviews and recommendations, whether they are from your current doctor, friends or even insurance can help narrow the options, but you ultimately need to follow your gut to select the best clinic for you. If you find that you’ll be working with an egg donor or gestational carrier to build your family, be sure that the agency and fertility clinic can work together. At ConceiveAbilities, we are well versed in working with a wide range of clinics all over the country. We make collaborating with clinics and centers easy because of our experience; we understand the importance of exceptional communication and adapting to individual protocol. You can learn more about just some of the clinics we have partnered with in the past. Working together, we can reach the common goal – successfully building your family.

    "content": "The decision to work with an egg donor does not always come easily. It often requires time and consideration to embrace this means of family building; what helps many people is the fact that it has the highest success rate of any assisted reproductive technology. But once the decision has been made, intended parents are faced with the next question – a fresh or frozen donor egg cycle? What’s the difference between fresh vs. frozen donor eggs? In an IVF cycle with fresh donor eggs, the retrieved eggs are immediately fertilized with sperm from the intended father or a sperm donor. These embryos are then either transferred to the intended mother or a surrogate, or frozen for future use. Frozen donor eggs, on the other hand are retrieved and then immediately cryopreserved before fertilization. They can later be thawed and fertilized with the intended father or selected donor’s sperm to create embryos for transfer. As far back as 2013, the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) reported that 20% of all donor egg cycles used frozen eggs. That number has only continued to grow as technology for the procedure improves. And while the success rates for a live birth from a frozen embryo transfer are now comparable to that of a fresh transfer, frozen eggs are still catching up. Pros and cons of fresh donor eggs Pro: Consistently higher success rates Though the use of frozen donor eggs has become more common, there’s a reason fresh donor egg cycles are still the rule: the success rates remain higher. The results of a 2017 study reviewed the most recently available statistics and found that a fertility cycle was 19% more likely to result in a live birth if the egg used had never been frozen. Pro: Multiple frozen embryos In a fresh donor cycle, intended parents are entitled to all eggs retrieved. And because recent research shows that fresh eggs are more likely to result in viable embryos, intended parents are more likely to have a greater number of embryos to work with. While that’s not an automatic guarantee of a live birth, it provides options. Not only does it give multiple shots at a successful embryo transfer, it also means you’re more likely to have embryos to freeze and use later for a full genetic sibling. Con: Unforeseen circumstances For some, the unknowns can be the scariest part of utilizing an egg donor. When participating in a fresh egg donor cycle, there are certain aspects of the process that simply can’t be predicted. Like any medical procedure, there can be unforeseen circumstances that may delay or prevent a cycle from happening. The donor may not react to the medication as expected, requiring a restart or cancellation. Rest assured that this is what a rigorous screening process and regular monitoring during stim injections are for; your agency and fertility clinic will do everything they can to mitigate these circumstances and keep you on track. Con: More coordination required What might be perceived as a con really becomes a non-issue when working with a reputable agency and clinic. A fresh donor cycle means that you’re cycling in real time with a real person with whom you typically don’t have any contact. That type of relationship requires some serious coordination! Your egg donor agency will manage all of the details, from connecting her with the clinic and legal representation to travel arrangements if applicable. Pros and cons of frozen donor eggs Pro: Little to no wait time While a fresh donor egg cycle typically takes about 3 months to complete – not including match time – a cycle with frozen eggs can get started as soon as you select your donor. There’s no need to sync cycles like you would in a fresh cycle, so the clinic can base all medical protocol off the intended mother and get to transfer faster. Pro: Typically lower cost IVF cycles with frozen donor eggs are typically less expensive than fresh donor eggs. Depending on the fertility clinic’s success rates with frozen eggs, however, the cost per birth may not actually be any lower. If you’re planning to use frozen donor eggs it is especially important to research and choose your clinic carefully. Con: Fewer embryos available While this is not a hard and fast rule, intended parents are typically more limited in the number of embryos they can expect as the result of a frozen egg donor cycle. You will receive what is called a “cohort,” or group, of about 6 to 8 eggs with which to create embryos. To help reduce cost, some people choose to share the cohort with another intended parent. This further limits the number of eggs to work with and can make it difficult to proceed in the event of a failed cycle or desire for genetically-related siblings. Con: Limited options For many, selecting an egg donor is among one of the most challenging decisions they will ever make. Moving forward with an egg donor means relinquishing a genetic connection of at least one parent; finding a donor who feels like the best possible match can give back a sense of control. A bank of donated eggs inevitably offer a smaller selection of donors; thus a smaller selection of qualities to choose from. Many intended parents don’t want to feel limited in their options and prefer the variety and personalized matching that a fresh cycle offers. Cost comparison Utilizing a frozen donor egg is undeniably the less expensive option at the outset. A cohort, typically of about 6 to 8 mature eggs, can range anywhere from $13,000 to $16,000 and up. This does not include any IVF-related fees. The cost of a fresh cycle typically starts at about $20,000 before transfer costs and includes compensation, psychosocial evaluation and legal fees. How to choose between fresh vs. frozen donor eggs Frozen donor eggs are a wonderful option for those who are risk averse and would like to proceed with a fresh transfer as soon as possible. At ConceiveAbilities, we have more than 200 donors available on our database for a fresh cycle for a reason – intended parents enjoy the benefits of a fresh cycle more. Not only is there a wider selection of donors, but also more eggs – that means more embryos to work with. There could be backup if the first transfer is not successful, or for future family building to add a sibling. There is also more possibility for contact with the donor in the event of a medical emergency or if the child wants to know more about his or her genetic background in the future. Ultimately, the decision to have a fresh or frozen donor egg cycle is as personal as the decision to work with a donor period. Our team is ready to answer your questions and support you along this unique journey to family building.",

    "content": "We know the statistics: between 10-20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. According to the March of Dimes, that number may be as high as 50% when we take into account pregnancies ending before a woman misses a menstrual cycle. It’s the difference between a viable and non-viable pregnancy. Dr. Sheeva Talebian, of CCRM Fertility in New York, shares that repeated miscarriages are among the factors that might lead someone to consider surrogacy as a means of starting a family. What leads to a non-viable pregnancy? We’ll explore the terminology, causes and options to help achieve a healthy pregnancy and baby. What does viability mean in pregnancy? The term “viable pregnancy” comes from the word “vita,” which is Latin for “alive.” In the first trimester of a pregnancy, “viable” means that a baby can be born alive. What is a viable pregnancy? A non-viable pregnancy means there is no chance of a live born baby. Depending on the stage of pregnancy, viability means different things. Before 6 weeks, it can mean that Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) levels are increasing normally. hCG is a hormone produced by the placenta during its implantation process in the uterus. After 6 weeks, a normal fetal heart indicates a viable pregnancy. A fetal heart with no heartbeat at any point is called fetal demise. After 22-24 weeks, a viable pregnancy is when a baby has a chance to survive outside of the womb. However, some countries without adequate neonatal care consider a pregnancy to be non-viable at less than 26-28 weeks gestation.Before 22-24 weeks, a non-viable pregnancy is when a baby delivered has no chance of survival, even if there is still a heartbeat in the uterus. Pregnancy is especially delicate in the first trimester, making it difficult to diagnose as viable or non-viable. These guidelines were developed to help define the ultrasound diagnosis of a non-viable pregnancy: Crown to rump length of > 6 mm and no heartbeat Mean sac diameter of > 24 mm and no embryo No fetal heartbeat >=2 weeks after a scan showed a gestational sac without a yolk sac No fetal heartbeat > 10 days after a scan showed a gestational sac with a yolk sac What are the symptoms of a non-viable pregnancy? On a technical level, the viability of a pregnancy can initially be measured by hCG levels. While a home pregnancy test can detect it in urine, the most accurate number comes from a blood test. The level of hCG should double every two or three days. Once it reaches 2,000 mIU/ml, embryonic development should be visible on an ultrasound. A chemical pregnancy becomes non-viable shortly after implantation. While hCG levels may initially be elevated, the pregnancy does not continue to develop and there are rarely any symptoms. Unless they’ve used assisted reproductive technology (ART), most women won’t even know they were pregnant. If a pregnancy becomes non-viable later in gestation, however, there may be a variety of physical symptoms: Mild to severe cramps Pain in the back or abdomen White-pink mucus Passing tissue or clot-like material Loss of pregnancy symptoms such as nausea, though this can happen in a viable pregnancy too Some women don’t learn their pregnancy is non-viable until they visit their doctor or midwife. By the 6th week of pregnancy, an ultrasound can determine whether there is a yolk sac within the gestational sac. The ultrasound should also be able to pick up a fetal pole, between the head (crown) and the bottom of the buttocks (rump); the length of the fetal pole is called crown-rump length. Finally, a healthy fetal heartbeat is a key factor in a viable pregnancy. Once the fetal heartbeat is present and healthy, the risk of miscarriage drops significantly. Can you have a non-viable pregnancy but no miscarriage? Yes. In what is known as a missed miscarriage or missed abortion, a pregnancy can be non-viable. The placenta may continue to release hormones, resulting in continued signs of pregnancy. If it’s early enough in a pregnancy, in most cases the body will eventually expel the fetal tissue naturally. If fetal tissue remains, however, it can become dangerous and must be removed. In this case, a D&C procedure is done to remove the tissue and prevent infection. This will also allow the body’s hormone levels to return to normal. What are the causes of a non-viable pregnancy? Unfortunately, many different factors come into play when determining the viability of a pregnancy. A chemical pregnancy, when the fertilized egg does not properly implant in the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy, when the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, typically in a fallopian tube. A molar pregnancy, when a tumor develops in the uterus at the beginning of the pregnancy as a result of a genetic error. A blighted ovum, when the pregnancy stops after the gestational sac forms. Abnormal chromosome count or congenital defects that prevent the baby from surviving. A birth that is so premature that the baby is unable to survive outside the womb. Are there non-viable pregnancy options? If you’ve experienced a non-viable pregnancy once, it doesn’t automatically mean that you can’t go on to have a healthy pregnancy in the future. You will be encouraged to wait between one to three menstrual cycles before trying for another pregnancy. After more than one miscarriage, however, it’s best to speak with your health practitioner. Further testing may be recommended, and you may ultimately consider assisted reproductive technology. Preimplantation genetic testing, for example, can be performed during an IVF cycle to help determine the healthiest embryos and reduce the risk of miscarriage. Surrogacy may also be recommended to help you build your family. Is Surrogacy An Option After Recurrent Pregnancy Loss? Yes, surrogacy is an option and it has the highest success rating of any fertility treatment. Moving down this particular path to parenthood may be unexpected, but it can significantly increase the chances of building a family. In fact, the technology behind surrogacy as well as egg donation lead to very high rates of live birth success. If you’d like to learn more about your options, ConceiveAbilities Surrogacy & Egg Donor Agency is here to advocate for you. How Can You Help Someone Experiencing Infertility? Many of our surrogates decide to become a surrogate because they can’t imagine not experiencing the joy of parenthood. They have also personally witnessed friends and family struggle with infertility and want to help someone like them have a family. Are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate?

    "content": "The world of surrogacy is a complex process that includes many moving pieces. While a reputable agency will ensure that you have a support team available to answer questions and quell anxieties, a more thorough grasp of the semantics will make anyone involved – intended parent or surrogate – feel more comfortable and in control of their situation. The importance of understanding surrogacy speak simply can’t be, well, overstated. If you’re already familiar with the basics from our Guide to Surrogate Speak, brush up on some of the general terms and read on for an advanced compendium of surrogacy definitions. General Terms Gestational Carrier The woman carrying someone else’s baby, fertilized using the intended mother or a donor’s egg and the intended father’s or a donor’s sperm. Also referred to as a GC or surrogate. The surrogate is not genetically linked to the baby in any way, as the baby is conceived via in-vitro fertilization. Intended Parent The legal (and often biological) parents of the infant born through a surrogacy arrangement. May also be referred to as the intended mother (IM) or intended father (IF). Domestic Surrogacy A surrogacy arrangement in which both the surrogate and the intended parent(s) reside in the United States. International Surrogacy A surrogacy arrangement in which the intended parents do not currently reside in the United States. For the purposes of ConceiveAbilities’ matches, all surrogates are from the U.S. in surrogacy-friendly states. Compensation The surrogate mother pay earned by a woman from the intended parents in a surrogacy arrangement. The amount can vary, but is separate from medical and legal costs and is earned for the dedicated time and effort a surrogate puts in over the course of many months. Medical Terms Informed Consent Permission granted in the knowledge of possible consequences; often given by a patient to a doctor for treatment with full knowledge of the possible risks and benefits. In a surrogacy arrangement, the informed consent includes but is not limited to the IVF clinic, the legal team and the surrogacy agency. Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) A self-report, 344-item personality test that assesses a respondent’s personality and psychopathology. Each item is a statement about the respondent that the respondent rates with a 4-point scale. It provides information relevant for screening for psychopathology and when combined with an evaluation from a mental health professional, is an appropriate tool to assess a woman’s eligibility for surrogacy. It is a required component of ConceiveAbilities’ rigorous pre-screening process. Monitoring Clinic An IVF clinic that can accommodate a surrogate in the weeks before the embryo is transferred to her uterus. Appointments may include blood work, ultrasounds and other testing to determine her eligibility for transfer. A monitoring clinic is typically used if the surrogate will be traveling to a different clinic for the transfer. Insurance Terms Infertility Coverage Health insurance coverage for infertility and IVF treatments. Currently, about 15 states offer an infertility coverage mandate to help with payment for fertility and IVF services. Surrogate Health Insurance Health insurance coverage specifically for surrogate mothers during the course of the pregnancy. Part of ConceiveAbilities thorough screening process is reviewing a surrogate’s current health insurance coverage, but intended parents are encouraged to purchase a Universal Life Plan through Lloyd’s of London. Comprehensive Surrogacy Insurance Health insurance purchased by the intended parent that allows a surrogate to see any doctor agreed upon by all parties and to deliver at any hospital. Newborn Health Insurance Health insurance for a new baby that is purchased by the intended parents. In the United States, parents have 30 days from the birth to enroll their baby. This ensures coverage is effective as of the baby’s birth date and cannot be subject to a preexisting condition clause. Legal Terms Legal Clearance The legal clearance status is granted by the surrogate’s and intended parents’ legal team once all necessary documentation has been fully executed. It is required by the agency before the surrogate and intended parents can have direct communication, and prior to the surrogate starting medical treatment. Escrow Account An escrow account is set up to ensure funds are properly dispersed at the correct time. In a surrogacy arrangement, money is put into the account at the beginning of the process by the intended parent so that the escrow agent can ensure payment to the surrogate as specified by their direct agreement. It is required in order to make the payments to the surrogate. Egg Donor Direct Agreement The direct agreement is the contract between you and your egg donor. This agreement will lay out all the terms and stipulations regarding your match. It is called the Direct Agreement because it is the only document in the process that is directly between the Intended Parents and Donor. Anonymous Signature Page Because you and the donor need to sign the Direct Agreement and anonymity needs to be maintained, both parties are asked to sign the anonymous signature page. You and the donor will receive a copy of this page for your files. You will sign as “Intended Parent” and the donor will sign as “Egg Donor.” Gestational Surrogacy Agreement (GSA) The GSA is the contract between you and the surrogate. Much like the Direct Agreement it will outline all the terms and specific information regarding your match. It also referred to as the Direct Agreement as it is one of the only document in the process that us directly between the Intended Parents and the Gestational Carrier. Parentage The parentage process happens after confirmation of pregnancy and will be handled by your in-state attorney. The process consists of drafting and obtaining signatures on all the documents required to assign you as the child’s legal parents and guardians. It is also the process in which the surrogate is relieved of all legal responsibilities to the child. The documents required for this process differ between states. Pre-Birth Order (PBO) The Pre-Birth Order is an example of a parentage document. It is a legal document assigning you as the legal parent of your child and not the surrogate. You may or may not need a PBO depending on the state in which your surrogate will deliver. If your match requires a PBO the process usually begins at around 15-18 weeks of gestation. Once the PBO is complete our legal team will ensure the hospital has the Order prior to the birth, but you will also take a copy with you at the time of delivery. Post-Birth Order Some states require a Post-Birth Order as a part of the parentage process. A Post-Birth Order is a document assigning you as the legal parents of your child. The Post-Birth Order will be drafted and ready for signature prior to the birth of your child and will be signed by the judge within a few days after your child’s birth. Healthcare Power of Attorney A health care power of attorney is a document in which you designate someone to be your representative, or agent, in the event that you are unable to make or communicate decisions about aspects of your healthcare. All states have statutes that authorize the form, scope, and requirements of this document. Second Parent Adoption Illinois, along with several other states, has laws that explicitly allow same-sex couples to adopt. Second-parent adoption occurs when the biological or legal parent of a child is in a relationship with another adult who wants to share parental rights and responsibilities. In contrast to a co-parent adoption (defined above), one of the parents shares a biological or legal relationship with the child. The biological or legal parent consents to relinquish sole custody of the child so that his/her partner can become a second, legal parent. Second-parent adoptions give the child two (2) legal guardians. The adoption protects both parents by giving each of them legally recognized parental status. If the couple were to later dissolve their adult relationship, each parent would be equally entitled to custody, which a court would determine based on the best interests of the child, without giving an automatic advantage or preference to either parent.

    "content": "Did you ever wonder why a prenatal checkup with the obstetrician or midwife includes a measurement of the belly? It’s to check the growing baby’s size and identify if intrauterine growth restriction, or IUGR, is a concern. While it only occurs in 3 to 7 percent of all births, it tends to be more common with multiples and can be indicative of other health issues. What is IUGR? Intrauterine growth restriction, sometimes referred to as fetal growth restriction or small for gestational age (SGA), is a condition in which an unborn baby is not growing at a normal rate in the womb – the result is that the fetus is smaller than it should be for the gestational age. There are two types of IUGR; primary, or symmetric, IUGR means that all of the baby’s organs are growing too small. Asymmetric, or secondary, IUGR means the head and brain develop normally but the abdomen is too small. Asymmetric is more common than symmetric IUGR. It is also characterized as a fetal weight less than the 10th percentile, meaning it weighs less than 90 percent of all other fetuses at the same gestational age. Simple measurements, using the distance from the fundus, or top of the uterus, to the pubic bone, give a fairly accurate estimate of a baby’s size and can indicate growth issues. An ultrasound may then be performed to get more accurate measurements. If IUGR is found early or is particularly severe, amniocentesis testing will likely be recommended to determine if there is any other associated chromosomal issue. Regardless, the delayed growth can result in a host of complications during the pregnancy, delivery, and after the child is born. IUGR risks include: Stillbirth Stress during a vaginal delivery Low Apgar scores, which is a test given just after birth to evaluate the baby’s condition Low birth weight Decreased oxygen levels Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar Low resistance to infection Abnormally high red blood cell count Difficulty maintaining body temperature Long term growth problems Cerebral palsy Newborns with IUGR may be thin and pale with dry skin; even their umbilical cord may appear thin and dull instead of thick and shiny. Not all babies will appear malnourished, but they will be small all over. What causes IUGR during pregnancy? It results when an abnormality prevents cells and tissues from growing properly, or it may cause cells to decrease in size. It can happen when a fetus is not receiving necessary nutrients required to develop properly, or because of an infection. It can be related to health problems the mother is dealing with, including: Advanced diabetes High blood pressure or heart disease Infections like rubella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, or syphilis Kidney or lung disease Malnutrition or anemia Sickle cell anemia Using cigarettes, alcohol or drugs during pregnancy It’s also more common amongst women who conceive within 18 months of a previous birth. Factors specifically related to the uterus and placenta include: Decreased blood flow in the uterus and placenta Placental abruption, when the placenta detaches from the uterus Placenta previa, when the placenta attaches low in the uterus Infection in the tissues around the uterus Factors related to the developing baby include: Multiples like twins or triplets Infection Chromosomal abnormality or birth defects Does IUGR affect brain development? A 2015 study showed that infants with IUGR were at high risk for antenatal, perinatal and postnatal complications. Infants with moderate to severe IUGR “are at increased risk of stillbirth and likely to be born preterm… growth-restricted infants present a high-risk subgroup of infants with a complex and distinct set of microstructural brain abnormalities not observed in appropriately grown infants.” Indeed, while babies with IUGR do not automatically experience long term brain damage or development issues, it does increase the risk for cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is a congenital disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture that can vary widely in severity. It is often marked by exaggerated reflexes, floppy or rigid limbs, and involuntary motion. Research indicates that the lower a baby’s size or weight due to IUGR, that more likely it is to have a more severe form of cerebral palsy. It’s unknown whether the slow growth causes brain damage, or if the damage occurs and results in IUGR. What we do know is that the postnatal period is critical; a baby’s brain grows by one percent each day in the few weeks after birth. Can IUGR be treated? Currently, there are no specific treatments for IUGR while the baby is in utero. The mother may be administered medications if she is dealing with any health issues, but it ultimately depends on the baby’s gestational age. If the baby is past 34 weeks, doctors may opt to deliver prematurely. If the condition is discovered before 34 weeks, they will likely monitor the situation closely until 34 weeks. At that point, they will decide if the baby has a better shot at getting stronger outside of the uterus rather than in. Multiples, which often deliver preterm anyway, may especially benefit if IUGR is preventing normal growth.

    "content": "Whether you’re pregnant with your own child or carrying for another family as a gestational surrogate, your goal over those nine months is a healthy baby. Regular prenatal care is an essential part of the process; when you start and how often you visit your obstetrician can help ensure both you and the baby are thriving. What is prenatal care? Prenatal care is defined as the health care you receive while you are pregnant. The benefits of prenatal care are numerous, both for the woman and the unborn baby. The U.S. Office on Women’s Health recommends getting both early and regular prenatal care. When should you start getting prenatal care? If you know you’re pregnant, or suspect you might be, it’s important to contact your health care provider to schedule a visit. Consider the type of care you’d like to receive during your pregnancy; will you work with an OB/Gyn? A midwife? Research the options in your area that most align with your needs. Depending on your situation and health history, you may go in for a confirmation pregnancy test. Your doctor may also perform an ultrasound to give a more accurate due date. Pregnancy is discussed in terms of months and trimesters. The first trimester is months 0-3, or weeks 0-17. The second trimester is months 4-6, or weeks 18-30. The third trimester is months 7-9, or weeks 31-42. Pregnancy is often thought of as 40 weeks, but full term is now considered any time between 39 weeks, 0 days and 40 weeks, 6 days. That spans 1 week before the due date to 1 week after the due date. And, at ConceiveAbilities, we are strong proponents of the Fourth Trimester, the 12 weeks after delivery, which is a crucial time for a strong postpartum recovery. In many cases, your first prenatal appointment may not take place until 8 weeks gestation. Prenatal care truly starts, however, the moment you even consider getting pregnant. Preconception health is an understanding of how your body is functioning, medications you’re taking and lifestyle considerations that could have an impact on your pregnancy and the health of the unborn baby. The Office on Women’s Health recommends women give themselves three months to prepare before getting pregnant. The five things to prioritize include: Taking 400-800 micrograms of folic acid every day for at least 3 months to reduce the risk of birth defects in the brain and spine. Research shows that daily folic acid reduces the risk of neural tube defects by 70%. Some foods, like cereals and grains, include folic acid but it’s best to get the necessary amount from a supplement. Stop smoking and drinking alcohol. In addition to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, the use of tobacco and alcohol has been shown to increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Work to manage any medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure and thyroid disease. Consider any medication or supplements you’re currently taking and confirm with your doctor if they are safe for pregnancy. If not, discuss your options. Avoid contact with toxic substances or materials, including chemicals. What are the current guidelines for good prenatal care? Prenatal visits with a health care provider will typically include a physical exam, weight check and a urine sample. Depending on the stage of the pregnancy, you can expect blood tests and ultrasounds. The very first appointment is typically the longest; in addition to a general exam, medical history and lifestyle will also be discussed. Blood work to determine blood type, blood count and Rh factor is completed during the first visit, along with testing for certain viruses and sexually transmitted diseases. This work up can help determine if there are any warning signs that the pregnancy is high risk; if so, prenatal care will be adjusted accordingly. Depending on the issue, you may also have appointments with a specialist. How many prenatal visits should you have? Pregnancy requires many appointments with your obstetrician – typically once a month during the first two trimesters, then twice a month during weeks 28 through 36, and eventually every week from week 36 until delivery. Women with high-risk pregnancies will be seen by their obstetrician more frequently. These check ups all serve a purpose and should not be missed. What is the cost of prenatal care? The cost of prenatal care ultimately depends on health insurance coverage. With insurance, most prenatal visits and diagnostic tests like ultrasounds are covered as “preventative” care. Without health insurance, the average cost of prenatal care is about $2,000. Planned Parenthood, community health centers and family planning clinics may offer free or low-cost prenatal care and you may qualify for health insurance through your state. Every state in the United States has a program to help women have healthy pregnancies. Whether you are pregnant for the first time or carrying a surrogate pregnancy, prenatal care is essential for the health of both you and the baby. Are you a woman who was enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate?

    "content": "Hashimoto’s disease, sometimes referred to as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. Autoimmune conditions are the result of your immune system producing antibodies that attack your own tissues. Hashimoto’s disease means white blood cells have attacked the thyroid enough to slow it down, and it can lead to infertility or complications during pregnancy if left untreated. Hashimoto’s Disease vs. hypothyroidism Hashimoto’s is a disease, while hypothyroidism is a thyroid condition that can develop because of it. Not everyone with Hashimoto’s disease will develop hypothyroidism, but it is the most common cause. If you have an underactive thyroid, or too little thyroid hormone in your blood due to an issue like Hashimoto’s, the body is unable to function normally. Symptoms of hypothyroidism often include fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, mood swings and irregular periods causing infertility. Can I get pregnant with Hashimoto’s disease? Yes, but since Hashimoto’s disease is linked to infertility it can make getting pregnant more difficult. That’s because decreased levels of thyroid hormone interfere with ovulation. If a woman is anovulatory, or not ovulating, there is no egg released for fertilization by sperm. Without fertilization, pregnancy cannot occur. How does your thyroid affect your pregnancy? Women can develop hypothyroidism during pregnancy. If untreated, it can increase the chance of miscarriage, premature delivery and preeclampsia, which is a dangerous rise in blood pressure during the third trimester. There is also a higher risk of birth defects, intellectual and developmental issues for babies born to women with thyroid disease. Is pregnancy safe with hypothyroidism? If treated, yes. The problem is that while it’s not especially difficult to treat, it often goes undiagnosed. Many symptoms of hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s mimic first trimester complaints like fatigue, so a woman may not even know she has it until later in the pregnancy. Experts say that someone with a high risk, past history or symptoms of Hashimoto’s or other autoimmune diseases should have thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, and thyroid blood tests done prior to conception, and thyroid function during pregnancy should be checked every 6-8 weeks. Hashimoto’s after pregnancy can still be an issue, but TSH levels often adjust by the third trimester. Hashimoto’s pregnancy diet While treatment of Hashimoto’s disease and hypothyroidism typically includes medication or Levothyroxine sodium pills, many find that prioritizing certain nutrients in their diet also help them to manage the condition. Iodine is a mineral that is vital to the production of thyroid hormone and can be found in table salt, seafood and eggs. Selenium has been shown to decrease the number of antibodies attacking the thyroid and can be found in eggs, chicken, beef, pork, and Brazil nuts. Zinc is another essential element in producing thyroid hormone. It can be found in lentils and beans, shellfish, beef, and chicken. A Paleo-inspired diet, which eliminates inflammatory grains, dairy and processed foods that can trigger an autoimmune reaction, is safe during pregnancy and can help keep Hashimoto’s in check. Can Hashimoto’s cause miscarriage? When the thyroid is functioning at a lower than normal level, it will impact other functions of the body; pregnancy is no exception. Evidence is still inconclusive regarding first trimester miscarriages, though a Chinese study in 2014 found that women with “both subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity have a greater risk of miscarriage between weeks 4 and 8.” There is greater evidence suggesting second-trimester miscarriages are more common. A 2000 study found that “women with untreated thyroid deficiency had a significantly increased risk of second-trimester miscarriage or stillbirth.” In 2005, a study found that “subclinical hypothyroidism could mean an increased risk of placental abruption and preterm delivery, both of which can result in later pregnancy loss.” Clearly, Hashimoto’s and hypothyroidism are conditions that should be addressed and treated as quickly as possible during pregnancy, if not before, to reduce the risk of miscarriage. Assisted reproduction as an alternative Because issues with thyroid hormones often lead to trouble conceiving, many women turn to assisted reproduction as an alternative. A 2016 study found that “having autoimmune thyroid disease did not seem to negatively impact the success of the fertility procedure itself and there were no differences identified in number of eggs retrieved, fertilization rates, implantation rates or confirmed pregnancy rates.” There was, however, a higher miscarriage rate and lower live birth rate. For women with severe thyroid issues who have struggled to maintain a healthy pregnancy, gestational surrogacy can be a viable option.

    "content": "##When is Surrogacy Indicated? In the Jewish Religion, having a baby is celebrated, which is why when plans are derailed due to miscarriage, cancer, abnormal uterus, or any other trauma that would preclude the woman from carrying a pregnancy, it is viewed as a loss. It’s the loss of a dream, an expectation that when the woman is ready for her body to be pregnant that her body will work. When kids are young, they rarely expect the need for someone else to carry their child. When children are born via Gestational Surrogacy, or Gestational Carrier, (used interchangeably), having a baby is no less special than a natural birth for the entire family. Gestational Surrogacy is defined as transferring an embryo created by two others (intended mom(s), intended dad(s), egg or sperm donor) into a carrier or surrogate to assist in carrying the baby to birth. The gestational surrogate is in no way genetically related to the baby. Very few people choose third party reproduction unless something went very, very wrong, or another perspective is the case of a same sex male couple where they have no other choice but to work with a surrogate. Judaism refers to building a family as a Mitzvah (a good deed), and Jews are actually commanded to “Go forth and multiply.” Branches of Judaism and Prospective Beliefs Regarding Surrogacy Infertility was mentioned in the Torah, as three Matriarchs suffered from infertility; Sarah, Rivkah, and Rachel, so obviously there are many Judaic perspectives. Judaism has a number of branches; Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Orthodox. Each branch sets its own standards for surrogacy. Judaism follows a maternal lineage, so the question of “Who is the mother?” is a very important question. Halachic law states that the woman who gives birth to the baby is the mother. However, there are obviously several interpretations based on each person’s religious perspective. Questions clients often ask, “Does my surrogate need to be Jewish?” and/or “Should they be single or married?” As a surrogacy agency, we hear these questions often. Unfortunately, there is no one definitive answer. If we lined up five Rabbis, we would most likely get five different answers. Our clients typically come to us ready to have a baby. Fertility treatments have already delayed those plans, and any further delays can create additional consequences such as the loss of ability to use one’s own genetics. Our process is designed to be as streamlined as possible to get you to your goal with the utmost efficiency. Everyone Deserves the Right to Pursue Family Most Rabbis have kept up with modern technology and understand the logistical aspects that we as the agency know all too well. Education is still needed, by groups such as Hasidah that provide educational seminars to Rabbis of all branches. Locating a Jewish surrogate, for example, can take months if not years, when other surrogates take only weeks to locate. Is Conversion an Option? For many, conversion is an option. The process of conversion for a baby is as simple as hosting a bris and taking the baby to a mikvah. The psychological aspects of conversion for some is an issue. If you and your spouse are Jewish, and intend to raise the baby as part of the Jewish faith, many question why a conversion is necessary. What We Recommend We recommend that you consult with your doctor and if you are advised that you might benefit from a surrogate, that you speak with your Rabbi. Talk with your partner or just ascertain the right route for you, based on your religious beliefs and the realities of the surrogate industry. Talk with a trusted agency to get a sense for how to process all of the information. Then ask to create an individualized plan tailored to your specific needs.",

    "content": "When it comes to having a baby through assisted reproductive technology, quality over quantity is what truly counts. In the four decades since IVF produced the first live birth, technology has developed by leaps and bounds and success rates grow by the year. The precision with which doctors can now identify a healthy embryo has improved dramatically with a process called comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS). We’ll explore what the screening entails, the best candidates, and the pros and cons to an increasingly popular option for intended parents. What is comprehensive chromosome screening? Comprehensive chromosome screening is done to analyze, select and transfer only the embryos with an appropriate number of chromosomes – a euploid, or normal, blastocyst. Conversely, aneuploidy describes an embryo with too many or too few chromosomes. How does comprehensive chromosome screening work? The testing is performed on a few cells from a day 5 embryo, called a blastocyst, which has hatched and started to develop an early placenta. Several cells are sampled from the placenta and sent to a genetics lab so that the chromosomes can be counted. The blastocysts are cryopreserved, or frozen, for about a week until testing is complete. Embryo survival after freezing is about 98%. Only the embryos with the correct number of chromosomes are selected for transfer – typically a single embryo at one time – or will remain frozen until the intended parents decide to use them. By refining the embryo selection process, embryologists can truly narrow down the healthiest embryos that are most likely to result in an ongoing pregnancy. Preimplantation genetic testing can be done on the embryos to identify further issues, but CCS is often sufficient. What is next generation sequencing (NGS)? The latest technological breakthrough in preimplantation genetic testing, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a DNA sequencing process that allows the study of all 23 pairs of chromosomes at a more comprehensive level and even deeper resolution. With NGS, an entire human genome can be sequenced within a day. For perspective, the previous sequencing technology – called Sanger sequencing – took several years to complete. Candidates for CCS While anyone can opt for CCS, there are several factors that make it especially beneficial: Women ages 35 or older, which often means a higher risk of clinical aneuploidy (Down’s Syndrome) Women with a history of repeated miscarriage Women with a chromosomal abnormality in a previous pregnancy Women with multiple failed IVF cycles CCS IVF success rate It’s suspected that 70% of early miscarriage is related to a chromosomal abnormality in the fetus. Screening the embryos in advance can help achieve a higher rate of pregnancy with fewer losses. A 2018 research study from the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine showed that, after identifying a normal, single euploid blastocyst through CCS, “live birth rates were almost identical in both age groups” being studied: 60 percent in women 38-42, and 64.6 percent in women 37 or younger. According to Dr. William Schoolcraft, “I’ve been taught and I tell my patients – or at least I have for the last 20 years – that age is everything. It’s a big if, but if you can get a chromosomally normal embryo suddenly that decline goes away. That to me has been the most remarkable thing about CCS.” On average, 1 out of 10 eggs will typically produce a chromosomally normal embryo. If, for example, 10 retrieved eggs result in 7 average embryos, it’s reasonable to expect 1 to 3 embryos with normal chromosomes after CCS testing. It should be noted that research shows implantation rates actually improve for a biological mother when a cryopreserved embryo is transferred; the thought is that a later, natural cycle – no longer under the effects of ovarian stimulation – allows for a more normal endometrial lining. If a surrogate is carrying the baby, she can be ready for transfer as soon as testing is complete. CCS Pros and Cons Comprehensive chromosome screening pros include: Improved selection of embryos Reduction in aneuploidy, and therefore less risk of miscarriage Improved implantation rate Less risk of multiple pregnancies because only one normal embryo is transferred CCS can also identify gender, which, depending on your stance, could be viewed as a pro or a con. Other CCS cons may include: A rare risk for errors in the results Something called mosaicism – in which not all the sampled cells are genetically identical, and something that occurs in about 4% of all cases The comprehensive chromosome screening cost can add about $7000 to an IVF cycle The data on safety is incomplete, and the data on live birth outcomes is still incomplete Due to the success of preimplantation genetic testing, experts are confident that CCS is an equally accurate and safe procedure. When paired with gestational surrogacy, which already has high success rates due to extensive testing and excellent uterine quality, CCS should only improve your chances of a successful pregnancy.

    "content": "After completing your family through IVF, you may find yourself in a position you never expected – more embryos than you know what to do with. If you have frozen, or cryopreserved, embryos that you don’t plan to use, you have several choices. You can continue to keep them stored for an annual fee, you can discard them, you can donate them to research, or you can donate them to another intended parent. In a process known as embryo donation, this allows the embryo(s) to be used by someone else to build their family. Whether you are donating or adopting, these are 5 important things to know about embryo donation. What is embryo donation? Embryo donation is a form of third party reproduction, a different version of sperm or egg donation. It allows a couple to experience pregnancy and become parents utilizing genetic material – in this case, fertilized embryos – provided by someone else. Often, when an intended parent undergoes in vitro fertilization, there will be multiple embryos remaining. Because technology has improved to the point that a single embryo transfer is the most effective and safest method, a couple may find that they have a surplus of healthy embryos they simply won’t use. The decision over what to do with these embryos can be challenging for many reasons; some couples decide that rather than discard what took so much time, effort and money to create, they’d like to give someone else a chance at a family. Embryos can be donated anonymously through programs at fertility clinics, while embryo donation is a more in-depth process that often involves an agency to help with matching and logistics. You may come across the word “snowflake” when exploring your options. What is snowflake adoption? This is a term used to encourage the donation of frozen embryos left over from another couple’s IVF cycle. What is the process to adopt an embryo? According to the National Registry for Adoption, there are six key steps to embryo donation. Step 1. Locate your donor embryos. This can be accomplished through a fertility clinic, agency, or even a friend or relative. Step 2. Get your doctor’s approval. Ask your doctor to review the medical history and potential risk factors. You can request medical and embryo records in order to obtain the most accurate information. Step 3. Sign a contract. Adopting an embryo is typically considered a property transfer, but your contract can be adjusted to language that reflects an adoption. Depending on your location, the adoption can be finalized in court. It’s generally not necessary. Step 4. Arrange transportation for the embryos. The clinic that is storing the frozen embryos will provide the information necessary to have them shipped to your fertility clinic. Step 5. Start taking medication. Once the embryos have arrived, your doctor will start your treatment protocol to prepare you for the transfer. Step 6. Frozen embryo transfer. The big event! You’ll complete the transfer at your clinic, and about two weeks later will be able to take a pregnancy test. What is the cost of embryo donation? On average, embryo donation costs range from $10,000 to $15,000. If you’re working with an agency to locate an embryo, you can expect agency fees and matching services in addition to the cost of a legal contract and shipment of the embryos from the clinic where they were created. This does not include the embryo transfer, however, and that cost can range from $4,000 to $8,000. Considering the fact that other forms of adoption may cost as much as $40,000, embryo donation can actually be one of the least expensive options. Is embryo donation successful? The average pregnancy success rate using embryo donation is 40%. Like many statistics, this will vary by program and fertility clinic. This number is slightly higher than standard IVF implantation success rates, generally because the donated or adopted embryos have undergone preimplantation genetic testing. Embryo donation pros and cons For intended parents, embryo donation allows them the experience of a pregnancy. They are able to control the prenatal environment and don’t run the risk of an donation falling through at the last second. Still, there are no legal guarantees with embryo donation. Because most states legally consider it a transfer of property, a contract that relinquishes parental rights may be considered invalid. It’s important to understand the laws in your state and have a solid contract between the genetic and adopting parents. Another point to consider? Many couples desire the genetic connection of at least one parent. And while the parents who have successfully built their families through IVF have spent a great deal of time, energy and money to create the embryos, it’s an emotionally complex decision. They must come to terms with the fact that their genetic offspring – a full genetic sibling to their children – will be born into and raised in an entirely different family. It’s important to consider the implications of this decision, both for themselves and their children.

    "content": "Is two better than one? Not when it comes to the number of embryos you transfer in your IVF cycle. What is SET? SET stands for Single Embryo Transfer. A single embryo transfer is the intentional transfer of one embryo when there are multiple embryos of appropriate stage and quality available. According to the CDC, single-embryo transfer (eSET) is a procedure in which one embryo, selected from a larger number of available embryos, is placed in the uterus or fallopian tube. The embryo selected for SET might be from a previous IVF cycle (e.g., cryopreserved embryos (frozen)) or from the current fresh IVF cycle that yielded more than one embryo. The remaining embryos may be set aside for future use or cryopreservation. Pros and cons of elective single embryo transfer Single embryo transfers have become the industry standard, leading to better outcomes for both the baby and the surrogate. Significant advancements in medical and genetic testing of embryos now ensure the selection of the most viable embryo for transfer. This not only enhances the success rate of full-term, healthy deliveries but also reduces the medical risks associated with carrying multiples for both the surrogate and the fetus. A pregnancy with multiples is higher risk than with a singleton. Rather than intentionally put a mother or a surrogate and babies in greater jeopardy, experts argued, why not utilize improved technology like Comprehensive Chromosome Screening (CSS). This form of genetic screening counts the total chromosomes and, while it’s not as comprehensive as preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), it is an accurate method to select the highest quality embryo for transfer. The benefits of SET are plentiful for the baby; studies find that, in conjunction with CSS, single embryo transfer babies were half as likely to be born prematurely, a third less likely to be low-birth weight, and less likely to spend time in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at birth compared to double embryo transfer multiples.

    "content": "The early stages of the surrogacy process can feel like swimming in a sea of paperwork. There are registration papers, release forms, and often an intended parent profile to complete. They’re not without reason; these documents are important requirements to help ensure a smooth surrogacy engagement. Thanks to our exclusive Matching Matters™ process, we’re able to cut down on the formality of an intended parent profile. Rather than requiring you to create a physical document – more paperwork – we do the match work for you. But that doesn’t mean you won’t participate; far from it. By sharing a bit about your life and your family during your Matching Matters™ Consultation, your surrogacy match expert will have all the detail necessary to shape your ideal match. These are four important things to consider as you prepare for your consult. Share your story. The Matching Matters™ process focuses on the art and science of a connection. It ensures you’re paired with a gestational carrier most aligned with what is important to you. The first step is meeting with a surrogate match expert. Think of this as a real-time intended parent profile. Why is the intended parent profile important? It provides a snapshot of you, your family, and the family you’re hoping to create. In your Matching Matters™ consult, you have the opportunity to include a true life depiction of who you are, both as individuals and as a couple. Share as much as you’re comfortable with regarding your fertility story and what brought you down this path. Talk about your relationship, your home, your family dog – elements of your life. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be for us to connect you with your ideal surrogate. When you meet your surrogate, remember she’s nervous too! Consider sharing how excited you are about becoming parents, and how grateful you are that she’s willing to help in this endeavor. Some prospective parents even write letters to surrogates if there is more they’d like to tell her directly. It doesn’t need to be anything fancy, but a heartfelt note can be a meaningful exchange at the beginning or end of the process. What shouldn’t you include in your profile? Remember that at this time, no identifying details are disclosed. Once the contract is complete, your Match Manager will assist you in exchanging contact information. Aside from that, don’t include anything that isn’t an honest reflection of who you are. The same goes for your consult. Don’t try to be someone you’re not, and certainly don’t say what you think your surrogate match expert or the gestational carrier herself wants to hear if it’s not genuine. The more you let your true personality shine through, the more personalized your match will be. Evaluate your values. A few days before your Matching Matters™ Consultation, have an honest conversation with your partner about some very important points that make up the foundation of your surrogate match. They’re not always easy questions, but your answers are part of the matching process and will be discussed in more detail during your consult as well as the match meeting with your potential surrogate. Medical aspects such as the number of embryos you’ll transfer, considerations on pregnancy termination or selective reduction, plus more emotional questions regarding expectations, communication, and future contact with your gestational carrier are all important things to consider. It’s recommended that couples work on their Matching Matters™ paperwork together, but some find they prefer to first jot things down separately. This can be a helpful practice for both your intended parent profile and your criteria for a gestational carrier; it gives you a clear picture of what you’re comfortable with as an individual, some insight into what is important to your partner, and helps you determine as a team what you value. Consider your ideal match. While it’s important to know what you’d like to share with your potential surrogate, be sure you also work together to consider the qualities of the person you will be matched with. After all, you’ll be in each other’s lives for at least a year! Who will your surrogate be? We place a lot of emphasis on figuring that out. There are four main points of criteria we encourage you to consider when you picture your ideal surrogacy engagement. These include medical and psychological criteria, legal considerations, values, and personal preferences. Keep in mind that if the criteria within these points are too restrictive, it can be challenging to create a relationship that works well for all parties. These details will be discussed during your Matching Matters™ Consultation, where your surrogacy match expert will offer suggestions about which items should be non-negotiable and which might warrant a bit more flexibility. Remember, the surrogates in ConceiveAbilities’ program have already passed the most rigorous screening process in the industry. That means her delivery records have been reviewed, she has passed the psychosocial screening and has had a home check – making her well positioned to pass your clinic’s medical screening. Not only does that mean less time and cost in the long run, but also less anxiety over the possibility of needing a rematch. Give yourself time. If you are looking for a surrogate, you’d likely prefer to have been matched yesterday. It’s understandable that you don’t want to waste any time; we want the process to move as quickly as possible for you too, but we also have a responsibility to see that all details have been addressed. While you don’t need an intended parent profile, your Matching Matters™ documents and consult are very important early steps in the surrogacy experience. They allow us to work our magic and find your ideal match. The results play a major role in the communication, expectations, and general relationship between you and your gestational carrier. Give it the time and consideration it deserves so that there is a solid foundation on which to build your surrogacy engagement. If you have questions or are ready to learn more about Matching Matters™, don’t hesitate to reach out for help! Most people don’t think about surrogacy every day – but we do. Remember that this is a team effort, and we’re here to support you every step of the way.",
