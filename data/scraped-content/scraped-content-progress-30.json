Can you recall a time when a nurse understood your needs even when you didn’t? We can. And, did you know that the pain of an infertility diagnosis is on par with the pain of being diagnosed with cancer, heart disease and other serious maladies? And that nurses are typically the first and most important resource attending to the emotional needs of these patients? We do. And we’re determined to help nurses in new ways. Read about our #EmpowerNursesChallenge. Do you know a nurse in your life that gives her heart to her patients? Empower nurses to take time for themselves! Nurses are the backbone of the healthcare system, playing a crucial role in patient care, advocacy, and emotional support. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, nursing is the nation’s largest healthcare profession, with nearly 4.7 million registered nurses (RNs) nationwide. Of all licensed registered nurses, 89% are employed in nursing. Nurses are the primary providers of hospital patient care and deliver most of the nation’s long-term medical care. Moreover, nurses are the single most trusted professional among a wide array, with 78% of us saying that they have high or very high levels of honesty and ethical standards. Nurses have held this distinction for over 20 years. The importance of nurses extends beyond clinical skills. Nurses give comfort and compassion to patients and families during some of the most vulnerable moments of their lives. This unwavering dedication often comes at a cost. Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. What is Compassion Fatigue According to The National Institutes of Health, compassion fatigue is defined as stress resulting from exposure to a traumatized individual. Professionals regularly exposed to the traumatic experiences of the people they service, such as healthcare, emergency and community service workers, are particularly susceptible to developing Compassion Fatigue. This can adversely impact the everyday lives of these individuals, as well as patient care and relationships with colleagues. It can lead to more serious mental health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. At ConceiveAbilities, in our efforts to support family-building through surrogacy and egg donation, we see and are particularly awed by the many fertility clinic nurses working with these families. At the same time, we know that the ongoing exposure to the lasting trauma of infertility creates substantial and real risks of compassion fatigue for these heroic nurses. Infertility is, indeed, a serious and traumatic condition. Nurses at our fertility clinic partners, as well as many of our surrogates who are also nurses, have experienced compassion fatigue but, at ConceiveAbilities, we believe that it does not have to be this way. Through our #EmpowerNursesChallenge, we are showing our appreciation to nurses by raising awareness about this problem and efforts to be resilient to it. As one gesture in a complex puzzle, we are thrilled to announce that we are donating 100 $100 gift cards to the nurses you know and love who join our challenge!

Resources to Combat Compassion Fatigue and Build Compassion Resilience Nurses are particularly vulnerable to compassion fatigue due to their everyday exposure to individuals that are experiencing trauma, including those that are suffering from infertility. Nurses also have the best insights about how to be resilient in the face of compassion fatigue. Through these videos, we want to assist nurses in sharing their best resiliency tips and strategies with one another. Here are some thought starters, based on five strategies to help nurses combat compassion fatigue: Implement Regular Self-Care Physical Health: Prioritize exercise, nutritious meals, and adequate sleep. Simple practices like staying hydrated and taking short breaks during shifts can make a big difference. Check out The Gym Nurse for workout split ideas and more health tips! Mental and Emotional Health: Engage in mindfulness, meditation, or breathing exercises. Take time for activities that bring joy and relaxation outside of work.

Here is Forbes list of Best Online Therapy Service of 2024. Foster Your relationships: Make time for lunch with a friend, date night with your significant other, and for your hobbies. Find your person who can be your sounding board to help you debrief from a hard day. Set and Maintain Boundaries Work-Life Separation: Develop clear boundaries between work and personal life to avoid carrying work-related stress home. Time Management: Learn to prioritize tasks and delegate when possible. Taking regular, scheduled breaks during shifts can also help manage stress. The American Nurses Association offers these Time Management Tips for Nurses. Foster Peer Support and Connection Support Groups: Join or form support groups with fellow nurses to share experiences and offer mutual support. Team Communication: Regular debriefings and open communication within the team can provide a sense of solidarity and shared understanding. Engage in Professional Development Continual Learning: Attend workshops, training sessions, and conferences focused on managing compassion fatigue and enhancing self-care techniques. Reflective Practice: Engage in reflective practices, such as journaling or discussing challenging cases with peers, to gain perspective and learn from experiences. Integrating these strategies can help nurses manage compassion fatigue more effectively, ensuring they maintain their well-being while providing high-quality care. What are your best tips?

    "content": "Share our #MilkDonationChallenge on social media and tag friends who are breastfeeding or pumping to donate breastmilk for money ConceiveAbilities, a surrogacy and egg donation agency dedicated to empowering women to find their giving journey, is once again launching a campaign to encourage lactating women to donate breastmilk for money and save infant lives. In two years, over 1 million individuals have helped to identify lactating women and make a lifesaving impact on infants in need of nourishment by promoting breast milk donation. The relaunch of the #MilkDonationChallenge recognizes the profound influence that a single act of generosity can have on those facing challenges. It aims to support lactating women who want to make a difference not only through their paid breast milk donations to help infants in need, but also inspiring other lactating women to join the giving journey. ConceiveAbilities’ Founder Nazca Fontes initiated the #MilkDonationChallenge to assist milk banks in replenishing their supply during the infant formula shortage. Since then, it continues as a significant movement. “Our vision to create a positive impact for families in need of nourishment has gained widespread attention, spreading rapidly across communities,” offers Fontes. “We are steadfastly dedicated to providing support for strong family foundations and for women who long to be part of these giving, growing and empowering communities.” The challenge runs until September 30, 2025. Do You Know a Lactating Woman? Here’s How to Join or Refer Them to Our the Paid Breast Milk Donation Challenge Everyone can play a role in the 2025 #MilkDonationChallenge and help us spread the word. Create a link and text, email and share that link on your social channels with potentially lactating women. Each person in your community who enters their information will learn more about how they can participate in the 2025 #MilkDonationChallenge. Second, donate breast milk to help families. Your breast milk donation can make a profound impact and every donor receives a $250 gift card for her time and effort.

Proof of donation must include: first and last name, phone number, date of donation, number of ounces donated, and the milk bank you donated to. It can be in the form of an email verification or donor portal photo. Not necessary, but an added bonus! Share a photo to help inspire other lactating moms to join the challenge (by sharing you agree ConceiveAbilities may use in our marketing including digital and social channels) Milk Donor Champion Stories Our Milk Donor Champions have made an incredible impact, contributing over 15% of the national milk bank supply.

Inspired by the giving nature of their surrogates, ConceiveAbilities Surrogacy and Egg Donor Agency launched the #MilkDonationChallenge in 2022, a movement to replenish milk bank supplies across the nation to help these families in need. The impacts of this shortage still persist. “In our work to help build families for more than twenty-five years, we know that many women find purpose in helping other families at a time of great need,” shared Founder Nazca Fontes, adding, “Like surrogacy, milk banks play a vital role in supporting families. We stand ready to assist all women who are able to help lift up other women, mothers, and families and help provide much needed nutrition to their babies. While there is – yet still – so much work to be done to address the infant formula shortage, we hope an increase of breast milk donations will be a lifeline for these families at this critical time.” Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services, adds, “Our surrogates are incredibly giving and often donate their breast milk after their surrogacy journey. By inspiring more women to donate, we hope those who are facing this uncertainty can rest easy at night knowing they can provide critical nutrition for their babies.” More Resources for Lactating Women: Do you need help finding lactation consultant services?

    "content": "Surrogacy, particularly social surrogacy, is often misunderstood. Many mistakenly believe Intended Mothers choose surrogacy for superficial reasons, like convenience or vanity, but these assumptions are far from reality. Social surrogacy decisions are often rooted in complex personal, professional, or health-related factors. Intended Parents may turn to surrogacy to safeguard their health, manage career demands, or ensure their family’s well-being. Judging these decisions without understanding their full context overlooks the deeply personal and sometimes difficult choices involved. Watch this video for a full explanation about Medical Surrogacy vs Social Surrogacy** What is the Difference Between Medical and Social Surrogacy? Surrogacy is commonly categorized into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While legal parentage considerations often drive this distinction, many Intended Parents mistakenly believe they can only pursue surrogacy for a “medical need.” But, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we strongly support all Intended Parents in their journey to grow their families, and appreciate a wide array of reasons for doing so — whether those reasons are medical in nature, or not. Surrogacy is typically classified into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While some assume surrogacy is only available for medical reasons, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we believe every Intended Parent deserves support in their efforts to build a family. Medical Need A clear medical need for surrogacy typically involves conditions that prevent Intended Parents from carrying a pregnancy to term. This includes scenarios such as: Diagnosed infertility Male same-sex couples Women without a uterus Individuals with life-threatening illnesses Additionally, specific fertility diagnoses, histories of cancer, necessary medication that is incompatible with pregnancy, and more may also qualify as medical needs. In addition, we have seen some mental health diagnoses rising to the medical need threshold. The “strength” of an Intended Parent’s medical need may impact which states they can match with a surrogate, as surrogacy laws vary across jurisdictions. The bottom line for a medical need is that a doctor (be it a reproductive endocrinologist or other appropriate specialist) has made a medical opinion and determination that the Intended Parents have a medical need to pursue surrogacy. The legal community typically will look for such a decision to be made in writing. Social Surrogacy On the other hand, anything that is not a “clear medical need” falls under the social surrogacy category. Unfortunately, this option often carries a stigma, with critics assuming the Intended Mother simply wants to avoid the physical aspects of pregnancy for reasons of vanity, convenience, or wanting to shift the risks to someone else. In practice, however, that is rarely true. The vast majority of individuals seeking parenthood through the path of surrogacy for reasons other than a “clear medical need” have a reasonable and valid need for surrogacy based on meaningful life circumstances. Here are some common examples of reasonable necessity: Professional Athletes: Athletes like professional ballerinas may have limited career windows where peak physical performance is critical. Her physical appearance and athleticism are critical components of her livelihood and opportunity for success. If she were to take time off to have a child, she risks her career. Surrogacy allows professional athletes a viable and crucial path to growing their family. Unexplained Infertility: In cases where a doctor cannot determine why a couple or person is unable to conceive and is uncomfortable making a medical determination that they cannot carry a pregnancy, some opt for surrogacy to ensure the best chance of having a child. High Risk Careers: Individuals in high-risk professions, such as pilots or construction workers, often face demanding physical challenges and potential hazards on the job. Choosing surrogacy allows them to protect their health and well-being, while also safeguarding their baby’s development. For a pilot, long hours, high altitudes, and fluctuating cabin pressure could pose serious risks during pregnancy. Similarly, construction workers may encounter dangerous environments that could jeopardize both the mother and baby. Surrogacy offers these professionals peace of mind, enabling them to continue their livelihoods without compromising the safety of their family. Familial Health Concerns: Intended Mothers with a strong family history of serious health conditions, like breast cancer, may choose surrogacy to avoid potential risks tied to pregnancy hormones. Challenging Recovery: Some Intended Mothers have a medical condition that does not inherently preclude her from carrying, but would make recovery from delivery an especially arduous, lengthy process. Surrogacy allows them to focus on their health and be present for their newborn child. Our Commitment to Building Families At ConceiveAbilities, we recognize that every family’s surrogacy journey is unique. Our focus is on understanding the why behind each decision– whatever that may be – ensuring that both the Intended Parents and surrogates feel fully informed and comfortable. Through our Matching Matters™ process, we work closely with surrogates to ensure they’re aware of the Intended Parents’ reasons for choosing surrogacy, whether it’s medical, not medical, or a combination of factors. “The key is transparency,” says Fran Caruso, Esq. “We help surrogates and Intended Parents build relationships based on trust and mutual understanding.” Ultimately, we are proud to support Intended Parents from all walks of life. We have deep regard and appreciation for the fact that there are a wide array of important reasons for why people pursue surrogacy. Begin your surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities today. We are honored to assist you in growing your family.",

    "content": "Managing surrogacy-related medical expenses can be complex, time-consuming, and overwhelming, and insurance companies often complicate the process. As your full service surrogacy agency, it is our job to guide and protect you through every step of the surrogacy process.

Common Surrogacy Medical Coverage Questions What is the cost of my surrogate’s medical coverage? The direct medical coverage for your surrogate is fully included in our All-In Program.

Any surrogacy pregnancy related costs that her insurance does not cover will be handled through our All-In Program’s direct medical coverage, which eliminates common exclusions found in standard policies. Can my health insurance cover surrogacy-related costs? No, your insurance will not cover medical expenses for the gestational carrier since she is not a member of your policy. However, once the baby is born, your insurance may apply to the baby’s medical care.

    "content": "Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. ConceiveAbilities spoke with Clinical Nurse Liaison, Kristina Fabis, APRN, FNP-BC, RNC-OB. Kristina was a labor and delivery nurse with over 23 years of experience before joining the ConceiveAbilities team. Kristina has been a surrogate three times with ConceiveAbilities, “Being a nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a surrogate has brought fulfillment and purpose to my life. It has allowed me to care for others in their time of need.” Read below to learn more about compassion fatigue and how Kristina recommends nurses take care of themselves. How have you experienced compassion fatigue in your nursing career?I’ve experienced compassion fatigue a few different ways and times throughout my nursing career. The majority of my career was spent in a busy Labor and Delivery unit that was frequently understaffed. Not only did I work full time but I was often required to work ‘on-call.’ I was at the hospital so much, both during the day and back overnight. It slowly led to exhaustion. While I would never let it affect how I treated or cared for my patients, my identity was slowly slipping away. I was beginning to forget who I was outside of the hospital; as a mom, wife, friend, daughter, you name it. I began to feel like I was ‘going through the motions.’ I was a robot who could only do one thing: care for others and never for herself. Over the years, we observed a notable increase in the severity of our patients’ conditions which often affected their post delivery recovery, even leading to emergency situations. That resulted in extremely stressful work environments. I began to experience burnout. What are ways you decompress, relax, and recharge when experiencing compassion fatigue?I really utilize my vacation time. I rely on my friends and family. I encourage others to speak up about their struggles and their experiences. Put the chore or household task aside and spend 15, 30, or 60 minutes doing something you love which brings you joy. I plan activities outside of the hospital and home to help me decompress. This includes spending time at the lake, training for a 5k, or even a quick girls weekend. What communities have helped you navigate the highs and lows of your nursing career?Undoubtedly, my work family was the #1 community that helped me to navigate the highs and lows of my nursing career. My co-workers and colleagues became my second family, especially considering how much time we spent around each other each week. More than anyone, they knew how I felt and the challenges we faced as nurses. When a hospital’s administration or our department manager left us understaffed and with limited resources, it was my fellow nurses that I leaned on and vice versa. Together we got through countless emergent and stressful situations. What advice do you have for other nurses struggling with compassion fatigue? Put Yourself First: Make yourself a priority. Develop new interests outside of medicine and your profession. Take Care of Your Health: Your health, including what you put into your body, how frequently you exercise and how long you rest, is important. Take a walk, even if only for 10 minutes; those additional steps do have an impact. Commit to a healthier diet. No change is too small. Have Something to Anticipate: Always have something that you are looking forward to. Leverage Available Support Networks: Look into your employer’s EAP (Employee Assistance Program) plan. Mental health is important. There are even numerous virtual platforms, such as BetterHelp, these days which make therapy and counseling possible from the confines of your own home. Ensure You Get Enough Sleep: Finally, don’t deprive yourself of sleep or underestimate its importance. How do you combat compassion fatigue as a nurse?

    "content": "Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. ConceiveAbilities met with Kelly Rayburn, a registered nurse with over 27 years experience, to talk about her work with compassion fatigue. While receiving her Masters in Nursing, Kelly dedicated her research towards compassion fatigue. Below are her insights and answers to some commonly asked questions surrounding compassion fatigue. Tell us about your academic work with compassion fatigue.My research project when I was getting my Masters in Nursing was on Compassion Fatigue. Two group members and I were all experienced Labor & Delivery nurses and had only heard the topic in relation to other nursing specialities. We decided to see if L&D nurses were also at risk for compassion fatigue. After an extensive literature review, we were not finding much information on compassion fatigue in our area of nursing. We created our own research study. The end result? Yes, L&D nurses are at risk for compassion fatigue. When people hear that I used to work as a nurse in L&D, they say, “Oh that must be so fun!” or “It must be so cool to hold babies all day.” Yes, it was fun. No, we do not hold babies all day. When things were good, it left one with a sense of pride and accomplishment. When terrible events occurred, however, which they unfortunately did, it left a traumatic mark on all involved. Our study identified L&D nurses were at risk for compassion fatigue and then focused on ways to combat it. Nurses are always supporting and caring for others, but who supports the nurse caring for others? How have you experienced compassion fatigue in your nursing career?For me, there wasn’t one clear event that led to compassion fatigue. An unresolved traumatic event, running a support group for bereaved mothers when you are grieving yourself, days of being in charge and making decisions for the unit, and being short staffed and working beyond your capabilities with no break all led to compassion fatigue. My first insights into compassion fatigue surfaced when I realized that when I got home from work, I had nothing left to give my family. I felt empty, unable to make the simplest of decisions, unable to enjoy their company, so exhausted that I just wanted to sleep, and lying in bed not able to sleep as the days replayed themselves. My personality was changing. I would sit in my car every morning wondering if I really did need to go inside the building, pray that “nothing bad would happen today on my watch,” and feel just an overwhelming sense of anxiety entering the hospital. When my job became more about charting defensively “in case” something happened, and less about providing the nurturing competent care that I should have been focused on, I knew it was time to leave the bedside. I no longer felt the joy that each delivery brought; I no longer felt I cared enough, did enough, or was enough. What are ways you decompress, relax, and recharge when experiencing compassion fatigue?My family is the most important thing in the world to me. When I left the bedside, I wanted to make sure it was to do something that would allow me more time with them. I decompress by spending time with my grandkids, playing with them, laughing with them, and snuggling them. I’ve learned all too well that you don’t get that time back. They recharge my sense of balance in this world. When I was in the deepest hole of compassion fatigue and depression, I sought solace and advice from friends. True friends that are there for the thick of it, including my bedside nursing friends who understood the fears and anxiety and my teaching friends who offered support when the pandemic hit and we all scrambled to find a new way of educating future nursing students. For me, talking relieved some of the burnout. When I was too tired to talk, I used other avenues of comfort, including listening to Christian music, reading, riding my bike, hiking in the woods, and crafting. Twice a year I go with friends to a weekend scrapbook retreat. There I can create memory books, reminisce about pictures, share stories, and just laugh with no other agenda. It is my “me time.” What communities have helped you navigate the highs and lows of your nursing career?Absolutely my faith. I pray to a higher being and trust that He is always looking out for me; my faith has been instrumental in my ability to survive compassion fatigue. While I do not get to service often, I listen to uplifting Christian music that “speaks” my story; these songs inspire me to be a better person and to have faith even when things seem impossible. My friends have also helped me navigate the highs and lows of my career. Their support, encouragement, advice, and time together helped me maneuver so much these past 30 years. My hobbies are an escape from my career; a time for me to be something other than a nurse, an educator and a manager. Immersion in my hobbies is one time I can just be me. What resources, products, and suggestions can you provide for other nurses struggling with compassion fatigue?When we started our research project, we were looking specifically at Labor and Delivery, Postpartum, and NICU nurses. We understand now, especially in light of the pandemic, that no specific specialty is immune to compassion fatigue. It isn’t even exclusive to nursing. Anyone who provides care for someone else who has pain, suffering, and mental anguish can experience compassion fatigue. My suggestions are: Find someone that you can trust and confide in. Seek a friend or a counselor who has experience with compassion fatigue. Journal your feelings and experiences. Explore what it is that you need to do in order to get healthy. We can’t care for others when we cannot care for ourselves. Is it time away, time off, time with people, time alone? Think about what makes you happy and do more of it! Even if it’s scheduling a few minutes a day to start and working up from there. I wouldn’t be a nurse if I didn’t throw this in here: proper sleep, exercise and nutrition. Again, start slow. A walk around the house, the block, the neighborhood. Reconnect with nature. Have a hobby that you have always wanted to try? Do it! A hobby sitting unfinished? Start it back up again. Finally, accept that it is ok to NOT be ok. As nurses we are accustomed to giving care, not accepting it. We advocate for our patients, but not often enough for ourselves. Understand that compassion fatigue and everything that comes with it is normal. The ability to recognize it and treat it allows us to survive it.

    "content": "Support Guide for the Military Wife Only those who experience it firsthand truly understand the unique demands of military wife life. And these challenges are faced not only by the service members on assignment but the family members who support them. Building your family with flexibility and care is key as you consider life in the service. At ConceiveAbilities, we support a number of military families as they pursue surrogacy, which is why we have put together this dedicated support guide tailored to help families navigate military life. Understanding Military Life with Family There are a handful of challenges you may face as a military wife, and even more if you have kids to parent. Fortunately, there are many other wives and moms who understand and have been through, or are currently going through, similar obstacles. Some of these challenges include: Parenting alone during spouse’s deployment Relocating to a new base across the country Finding community and support where you live Knowing how to utilize healthcare services for pregnancy, childbirth, maternity, and pediatric care Choosing a suitable career that is flexible with the military lifestyle Below, we’ll address common questions related to these challenges and offer some tips from other military wives and moms who have learned through their experiences how to adapt and thrive in the midst of the demands of military wife life. Common Military Questions & Answers About Being a Military Wife Deployment and Parenting How do I parent alone during my spouse’s military deployment? Parenting solo isn’t easy, but by following some helpful, tried-and-true tips from other military wives, you can do it! A Mother Far From Home recommends: Embracing community for yourself and your kids Hiring a babysitter so you can run errands, spend time with friends, and relax Asking family to come for a visit to offer a helping hand Celebrating the little things, like making it to the next month as a kind of countdown until your spouse returns Establishing a routine for your kids. Their lives may change a lot, but their day-to-day routines can remain somewhat consistent Communicating with your spouse whenever possible; and when you aren’t on a call, talk about them with your kids Prioritizing your mental health by keeping your mind in the present and seeking help when you need it What are some ways I can help my child cope with a parent’s deployment? First, know there are military and family life counseling programs available to you and your children. Don’t be afraid to utilize these resources and support during this time. A few other things that could help include: Letting them voice what they’re feeling to you; listen with an open mind so they know they’re heard Allowing them to get involved in clubs, sports, or other community activities as a healthy distraction throughout the week Keeping a consistent routine to their day Maintaining long-distance contact with parent whenever possible Planning activities like making homecoming signs, special countdowns, or crafting memory scrapbooks How can we maintain a strong family bond when my spouse is deployed? Maintaining a strong long-distance relationship as a couple and a family can be difficult, but the biggest help is openly communicating one another’s expectations and making a plan ahead of time. Some expectations to discuss include: How do you plan to keep in touch (phone, texts, social media, Facetime, zoom, email, letters)? What methods of communication would be most helpful for each person to feel emotionally connected to the other (care packages, singing songs together, sending videos or pictures, starting a journal to record and share special memories and moments)? Consider asking other military spouses you know what worked best for their family for more ideas.Relocations and Transitions How can I help my child adjust to new schools and make friends quickly after military relocation? One of the best ways to help your child adjust to their new school is by getting involved. The first person you can contact is the school liaison officer who focuses on helping students with school transitions. Next, consider joining the PTA or getting involved in the school Facebook group to look for ways you can volunteer at the school. This is a great way to get to know other parents and help your kids get connected with new friends. What resources are available to help us understand each new location better for an easier transition? Similar to most new moves, one of the best things you can do to get to know a new city is to get out and explore. Try out coffee shops and local restaurants to find places you might want to frequent while you’re there. You can also get on social media and get connected with local groups to discover events happening near you or find common interest groups you might want to join. If your kids start joining sports clubs or teams, that’s another great way to fill your time and get to know local residents who can give you recommendations for things to do and see. How do I maintain my own career with frequent moves due to my spouse’s military transitions? If you’re already established in a job you enjoy, consider asking your boss if you can stay on and work remotely. While that may seem like a big ask, and your ability to do so will depend on the job, you don’t have much to lose. Not to mention, with the rise in remote work, it’s entirely possible they will be willing to work with you. At the very least, it shows your level of care for the organization or company and desire to stay on with them, which could open up future opportunities to come back and work for them when your spouse’s assignment is done or if you happen to relocate back to the area. When remote work is not an option, consider searching for a future job in your profession that has your needed flexibility. Community and Support Where can I connect with other military spouses who understand what I’m going through? Aside from getting to know other families your spouse works with, locally stationed at the same base, there are groups you can join, from military spouse groups listed on MeetUp and Facebook to programs like the Military Spouse Advocacy Network. Any of these groups would be helpful to connect with so you can combat common feelings of loneliness as a military spouse. How do I stay connected with friends and family who are far away? There are many tools at our disposal today to help us stay connected with friends and family when you live far away. Some of these include tools like Facetime, Zoom, texting, mailing letters and care packages, WhatsApp, Marco Polo, SnapChat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and GroupMe. Just be mindful of safe social posting practices when your spouse is active in the military for your safety and theirs. Where can I find information about local community events and activities for military families to get involved in quickly? One of the best ways to find this information is through local Facebook groups, newspaper or news station event announcements, or searching on Google for a list of activities near you. Accessing Healthcare Services How does our family access healthcare services after relocating? There are a few options for families when looking for a provider that accepts a TRICARE plan. The first is visiting the military treatment facility (MTF) on base. This will be the easiest method of seeking care, but it’s not the only one. The other option is to search for a military hospital or clinic, network provider, or non-network provider using the TRICARE website. What are TRICARE’s coverage options for maternity care and pediatric visits? TRICARE has an extensive list of medical services that are covered in relation to conception and delivery, including prenatal care, post-partum care (generally 6 weeks after delivery), and treatment of any complications. Discover a more comprehensive list of services on the TRICARE website as well as your plan options. For pediatric visits, TRICARE says it covers office visits, immunizations, and vision screenings from birth to age 6 at no cost, regardless of plan selection. Learn more about their pediatric healthcare services on their website. What mental health services are available through TRICARE? Is this available for spouses and children? There are a number of mental health therapeutic services available for military personnel, as well as their spouse and children. For a full list of services, visit the TRICARE website here. Flexible Career Options What are the best career fields for military spouses? The best career opportunities for military spouses are going to be jobs that allow for remote and flexible work. This is ideal when needing to relocate and for managing more at home during your spouse’s deployment. How can I continue my education or professional training online? If you’re in school finishing your degree, or taking classes to further your career, speak with the professor or school about continuing your education online or transferring your current course credits to an online educational institution. Are there specific employment programs to help military wives find jobs? There are services available like Hire Heroes USA that helps you prepare for and find a flexible job as a military spouse, or even for veterans when your spouse finishes their duty. Stories of Resilience and Success Growing up as a military brat and eight years as a military spouse, ConceiveAbilities surrogate and employee, Tayler Lewis has a deep passion for both the military community and surrogacy. In a heartfelt conversation on our podcast, “All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes,” Tayler shares, “As a military spouse, we tend to resonate with words like “calling” and “purpose.” We may not serve in the same capacity as our active duty partners, but we strive to make a difference. That can look like volunteering, engaging in our community, and supporting others as they navigate the challenges of military life. We are also on a mission. We truly believe that we are fulfilling an important purpose. Military spouses are known for their resourcefulness, for creating strategies, and for executing plans. Surrogacy provides us with a similar sense of calling.” Listen to Tayler’s full podcast A Calling to Serve: An Interview with Military Spouse Tayler Lewis on Becoming a Surrogate. Read more stories from military spouseswho found their calling through surrogacy. How Surrogacy Fits into the Military Family Lifestyle Surrogacy is a process in which a woman carries a child who is not genetically related to her for someone else. The motive behind surrogacy—helping someone in the community who can’t have a child of their own—aligns well with the military family lifestyle in desiring to serve others. It offers significant financial compensation while providing the flexibility military families need to be present with their own family and do something that can be accomplished in the midst of frequent relocations.“I wanted to become a surrogate for as long as I can remember. After having two easy pregnancies, I felt it was time to share my super amazing ability as a woman to help a deserving family. At the time, my husband was stationed in Illinois on Recruiting Duty for the Marine Corps, so I took the opportunity to pursue my dream; he was supportive from the very beginning! Knowing that I could help create or grow a family was the most amazing feeling in the world.After a successful delivery of a baby girl, my heart was full and I knew my life had changed forever. I decided that surrogacy was something I was extremely passionate about, so I decided to pursue it in my career as well. Now, I work here at ConceiveAbilities as a Surrogate Engagement Coordinator, helping potential surrogates get started on their own surrogacy journeys. I can’t imagine a job more fulfilling and I am still able to help grow families every day.” Ashley Wilson, Experienced Surrogate, Mom of 2, Marine Wife Learn More About Surrogacy as a Military Wife",

    "content": "How to Ship Frozen Breast Milk Can you ship breast milk? Yes! Whether you are a new mother who is breastfeeding or you are a lactating surrogate who is preparing to ship breast milk to intended parents, you may be wondering how to ship breast milk. Working moms traveling for business may also find it beneficial to ship their milk home. No matter your reasons for wanting to ship breast milk, our team can help. We put together a comprehensive guide on how to mail breast milk effectively and safely, including some important do’s and don’ts on mailing breast milk, ensuring your milk arrives in the best condition while you focus on how to maintain and increase milk supply. Steps to Shipping Breast Milk First, select an insulated shipping container. You can search on platforms like Amazon for a container that is leakproof and structurally sound for transport. Collect your breast milk. First, label durable, BPA-free bags, bottles, or pouches with the date. Then, use a breast pump to fill them with milk, remove the excess air, and seal them. Be prepared to freeze them as soon as you finish this step.Pro Tip: As you’re filling your bags/bottles/pouches, leave some room in them; the milk will expand when frozen. Otherwise, they will burst. Once the milk is frozen, pack the breast milk in your insulated box as tightly as possible. The milk should go into the box first, then the other items to cool and insulate it. Shipping a smaller amount of milk? You can nestle it between layers of ice packs.Pro Tip: If the milk doesn’t fill the box, you’ll want to strategically load up the rest of the box. Add in packing material such as newspaper and then put the frozen gel packs or ice packs on top, cover it with a plastic bag, and then seal it in the box. Want even more peace of mind? Include a temperature monitoring device within your shipment, which can ensure the milk maintains a safe temperature. Finish packaging the shipment by taping it up with duct tape and labeling it. Label requirements may differ across courier services, so inquire about additional information if needed. There are additional methods for packing up your breast milk. For instance, you can use thick-walled Styrofoam coolers and cardboard boxes. Simply store your breast milk storage bags in the cooler and place them in the cardboard box or shipping box. Make sure to choose a cooler that is not too large but is large enough for the ice packs, insulation material, and breast milk. Watch our How To Pump, Ship and Donate Breast Milk Surrogacy Tutorial with Lactation Expert Lenna Gregory Do’s and Don’ts of Shipping Breast Milk Do: Use an insulated box. It needs to be sturdy, as well as able to withstand freezing and thawing. Pack tightly. You want to preserve the milk and prevent it from moving too much in transit. Label the package properly. As you’re writing your labels, indicate that the shipment includes frozen breast milk that is perishable. Breast milk is considered “liquid gold“ and must be treated as such! Ship overnight, as you want the breast milk to stay frozen in transit. DHL, FedEx, UPS, and USPS offer milk shipping services, so you can rest assured your shipment will maintain its temperature and be delivered quickly. You can also check out specialized organizations like Milk Stork that take care of shipping for you. Consider timing when shipping your breast milk. You will want to avoid shipping later in the week; weekend deliveries generally cost more, and on Sundays, there is no delivery service. Earlier in the week, such as on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, you are less likely to face delays. Update the recipient on shipping details. By providing the recipient with relevant tracking information, you can prepare them to accept your shipment and store the milk right away. Don’t: Freeze breast milk without removing air first. This can result in freezer burn. Use dry ice. It doesn’t melt, but rather, goes through sublimation. In other words, the dry ice changes from a solid to a gas. Because of this, pressure could build up in your package, and it could even explode in transit. Ship 2-day. Do not use 2-day services or ground service to ship milk. It will thaw. Because breast milk is perishable, it must be transported swiftly in a temperature-controlled environment. Make sure milk is being shipped by an overnight service that is guaranteed. Pack loosely. The contents of your package need to be snug. Bubble wrap, crumbled newspaper, and foam peanuts can be used for padding. If you need an alternative, you can purchase shipping kits from companies like Save the Milk. Pack and ship breast milk without researching local laws in your location and the recipient’s location. This is extremely important if you plan to ship breast milk internationally. Though it’s legal (and relatively straightforward) to ship breast milk within the United States, you may have to abide by additional requirements based on that specific country’s regulations.On a similar note, if you’re donating breast milk to a milk bank or hospital (especially the NICU), you will likely need to follow specific instructions from them as well. Handling Breast Milk Upon Delivery As long as milk is over 50% frozen when it arrives, it can be put into the freezer and be safe to feed to babies. Families receiving the milk should open the package and inspect the milk to make sure everything is frozen and in good condition. Then, they should freeze it immediately and use it within 6 months (if stored in the refrigerator freezer) or 12 months (if stored in the deep freezer). Of course, breast milk shipping experiences between women will be different. For example, service providers’ pricing—and how they determine shipping costs based on distance to the destination, package weight, and other factors—will vary. But, with careful planning, shipping frozen breast milk can be a smooth and rewarding experience, leaving you to concentrate on maintaining and increasing your milk supply. Looking for more guidance?

    "content": "At ConceiveAbilities, we have the honor of working alongside military spouses, every day, who dedicate themselves to serving others. Meet four of our military spouses: Tayler, Vanessa, Laci, and Ash. These ConceiveAbilities employees have supported their military spouses’ call to serve. Now, they are answering their own call to serve, by helping build families through surrogacy. This Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we celebrate these ConceiveAbilities employees who have served their communities in more ways than one. Read more about these incredible women below! Pictured: Ash and her husband Please tell us a bit about yourself: Tayler: My name is Tayler and I am a Surrogate Advisor at ConceiveAbilities. I have two beautiful children of my own and I proudly delivered a surrogate baby in 2022. In this season of my life, I am still discovering who I am beyond my roles as a spouse and mother. I’m a licensed skydiver, a former veterinary technician with a decade of experience, an avid adventure seeker, and, at my very core, I am an empath. My empathetic nature gives me a deep understanding of the emotions and experiences of others, which drives my desire to support and uplift those around me. Vanessa: My name is Vanessa. My husband and I have three amazing kids: Bradley (9), Arlyn (7), and Adler (2). As a family, we love to stay active by skiing or hiking as much as we can here in beautiful Colorado Springs, our favorite duty station. Ever since the birth of my first child, I have had a strong passion for birth. I quickly became a childbirth educator and doula to help serve other expecting moms in the cities we were stationed. Ultimately, my love for pregnancy and birth led me to pursue a surrogacy journey which I just completed in October 2023. Now, I have the joy of helping other women begin their surrogacy journeys as a Surrogate Advisor at ConceiveAbilities. Laci: My name is Laci Compton. I have been a surrogate through ConceiveAbilities and now work as a Surrogate Advisor! I live in New York State with my husband and our two daughters Lila and Holland! We have a small zoo with two cats, one dog, and a hamster and we are looking to add chickens this year. We are Montana natives but our heart is in Alaska and we cannot wait to get back there someday when my husband retires. Ash: My name is Ash Golike! I’m originally from California but I have lived in the Southeast for 8 years. We recently PCS’d (Permanent Change of Station) to Fort Campbell and live in Tennessee. My husband and I are high school sweethearts, and together we have two kiddos, Izzy (8) and Isaac (3). As a family we enjoy kayaking, hiking, exploring new places or simply snuggling up on the couch to read a good book or watch a fun movie. I work as a Health Information Specialist at ConceiveAbilities. What branch of service is your spouse in? Tayler: My husband, Mason, was a sergeant and served in the United States Army as a firearms instructor and a cargo specialist. He served for 8 years. Vanessa: My husband Mike is in the Air Force. We are almost to the 20 year mark! Looking forward to retirement, and hoping to never move again. Laci: My husband is a Warrant Officer in the Army and he works as a Blackhawk Pilot. Ash: My husband is in the Army. He started out as a combat engineer but just recently became a Medevac Helicopter Pilot. Pictured: Tayler and her husband, Mason Did being a military spouse influence your decision to help build families by becoming a surrogate? Tayler: Being a military spouse had a significant impact on my decision to help build families through ConceiveAbilities, in addition to my own personal reasons for embarking on such a journey). I conducted extensive research and followed other military spouses sharing their experiences. ConceiveAbilities was full of selfless women on a mission to build families and also offered the most incredible support system I could have asked for. These women understood the journey both as mothers and military spouses, providing a sense of camaraderie and encouragement that made all the difference. Vanessa: Being a military spouse, it’s in our DNA to serve and help others. I have met so many amazing families over the years and the struggle of infertility has always been on my heart. I wanted a way to tangibly help. Laci: Absolutely! Military spouses tend to stand in the shadow of their soldiers. I wanted something of my own and to give back in any way I could. I now work for ConceiveAbilities since my journey gave me so much joy and I knew I wanted to turn that into a career. As a full-time employee, I have taken this job with me to four states as we moved for my husband’s career. Ash: I have not been a surrogate, but I am honored to work with surrogates every day. As a military spouse, my husband’s career and our life together has always centered around putting others first. It’s a sacrifice we have both made in our own roles as a service member and a spouse. Because of this, I’ve always gravitated towards wanting to help others and making a positive impact wherever I go. The most magical moment in my life is when I became a mom. Although each journey to parenthood is unique, there is no beauty that shines brighter than that of a surrogate with a good heart willing to make dreams come true. Pictured: Laci and family How has your experience as a surrogate changed your life? Tayler: From 2021 to 2022, I was a surrogate with ConceiveAbilities. This was an experience I had discussed with my husband since giving birth to our last child. As a military spouse, I resonate with words like “serve,” “calling,” and “purpose.” We may not serve in the same capacity as our active-duty partners but we strive to make a difference. This can involve volunteering, engaging in our community, or supporting others as they navigate the challenges of military life. When we take action, we truly believe we are fulfilling an important purpose. When you blend that sense of mission with the desire to help others through surrogacy, it brings about a profound and loving fulfillment, providing a genuine sense of life-changing purpose. It was empowering to know that I could “serve” in my own way: I could financially contribute to our family and, no matter where the Army sent us, I could pick up those roots and plant them where we were called next. Vanessa: Surrogacy has always been on my heart after a fellow military spouse needed the help of a gestational carrier. We were stationed back to back in non-surrogacy friendly states, but finally landed in Colorado where I was able to pursue a journey after the birth of our third baby. Laci: Surrogacy was the most rewarding experience of my life. At the time, I had just decided to stop working to be home full-time with our two-year-old. I knew I always wanted to explore surrogacy because I wanted to share the gift of maintaining a healthy pregnancy that came to me so easily. I knew others struggled but what I did not expect was the immense sense of purpose it gave me. I felt like I was not only contributing to my family financially but I belonged to something so much greater than myself that we all took part in! Pictured: Vanessa and her Intended Parents How has your work and/or experience with ConceiveAbilities help you serve others? Tayler: Helping build families as a military spouse, surrogate, and employee with ConceiveAbilities has been a deeply personal way for me to serve others. I often meet applicants who share the lifestyle I experienced for 28 years and I have the privilege of guiding them through the screening process as one of the first people they connect with on their journeys. Beyond my professional role, I aim to be a true friend to these women. I offer advice and support with a sense of empathy and understanding, as someone who has walked a similar path. Vanessa: Being able to help another family grow was such a joy! I’m excited to help other families through my role with ConceiveAbilities. Laci: We now consider our former “Intended Parents” family. We are unbelievably close and get to go through life together celebrating this boy we brought into the world. This has impacted me greatly and is the most rewarding experience of my life. Being a surrogate was my way to serve and being an employee with ConceiveAbilities is how I continue to serve. Every day I get to help build families; what is better than that? Ash: ConceiveAbilities is so special to me because it allows me to serve families who might be in need and to invest in surrogates who are passionately wanting to be the light for others. Inspired by our military spouses? If you are a military spouse and are called to become a surrogate, we have resources for you, including other military spouses who you can connect with.

    "content": "Nurse Appreciation Week is the perfect time to shine a spotlight on the unsung heroes of healthcare: nurses who tirelessly devote themselves to helping build families. At ConceiveAbilities, we are proud to have fifteen amazing nurses on our team who dedicate themselves to guiding our surrogates and families through the surrogacy process. It is our privilege to take a moment to recognize the remarkable contributions of each of our nurses on staff who go above and beyond each day to make a difference. We highlight here just four of our very special ConceiveAbilities nurses who bring their expertise to helping build families: Kelly, Erica, Kristina, and Nicole, experienced nurses with a combined 75 years of nursing experience and two of whom were surrogates themselves!! Why did you answer the call to become a nurse? Kelly: I was actually a pre-med student and getting ready to take my MCATs. A short hospital stay and having an incredible nurse care for me started turning my wheels and I began to ask myself what exactly I wanted to do in healthcare. A short time later I transferred into the nursing program and have been a nurse now for thirty two years. Erica: My mom works in the medical field and growing up I would sometimes go with her to her patient’s house. I found that I have always enjoyed helping others and when I had my children, I knew that Obstetrics was where I was supposed to be. I have now been a nurse for six years. I knew that God wanted me to be the support person for women and families experiencing the joy and heartbreak of labor and delivery. Kristina: I have had the honor of being a nurse for eighteen years and a nurse practitioner for five years. Prior to becoming a nurse, I had worked for an insurance company processing health and dental claims and then for two additional companies in health information technology. While I enjoyed my work, I felt a strong pull to become a nurse, to give of myself and to make a difference in someone’s life. Nicole: Growing up the oldest in my family, I was always looking out and taking care of my younger brothers. I have always shown compassion and empathy and enjoy helping others. Becoming a nurse fourteen years ago was the perfect extension of that. How has being a nurse impacted your life for the better? Kelly: Being a nurse has given me so many amazing opportunities for growth, allowed me to do something I love while still being home and available for my kids (including many many years on nights), fueled my inquisitive mind for medical research, and gave me the tools to teach other aspiring nurses. Erica: Nursing has brought many wonderful people into my life. Friendships in the nursing world are founded on a bond of trust and mutual commitment to improving human life and I am eternally grateful for the relationships I have made in my career. Kristina: Being a nurse and a nurse practitioner has brought fulfillment and purpose to my life. It allows me to care for others in their time of need and to promote health and wellbeing. Nicole: I have been able to experience the joys of becoming parents with my patients and made so many amazing connections with people throughout my nursing career. How did being a nurse impact your decision to become a surrogate and how did it change your life? Erica: My passion for nursing played a significant role in leading me to become a surrogate. Assisting families has always brought me immense joy, and I believe that surrogacy is the ultimate way to make a positive impact on creating families. In labor and delivery, I have seen many people struggle to have a child and the joy they experience when that finally happens is beyond words. I knew early on that I wanted to be able to help another family experience that joy. I knew I wanted to take an active role in helping someone achieve their dream of growing their family. Surrogacy was the answer for me! There is no greater joy than being a part of this process. The extended families that I have formed though the process of surrogacy are ones that I will cherish forever. Kristina: I am a three-time surrogate, having carried a total of five babies for three different couples. As a labor and delivery nurse, I had a deep knowledge of the pregnancy process and I knew that I would have the support not only of my friends and family but from my nurse colleagues…..and my obstetricians whom I worked alongside everyday at the hospital. I’ve always felt a pull or calling towards obstetrics and truly been enamored by the miracle of life. Creating my family had been relatively easy and I was more than aware that for many that is not the case. I had been raised to give back, to volunteer, to ‘do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.’ I felt that if I could do something like this for someone else, why wouldn’t I? Would I have wanted someone to do the same for me if the situation was reversed? How has your nursing background expanded your capacity to care for others while working with ConceiveAbilities? Kelly: As a nurse at ConceiveAbilities, I am helping to ensure our surrogates have been medically screened and can safely move forward in the process. Ensuring safety, building trust, showing empathy, and rejoicing when the goal is met (sounds like a nurse caring for a patient, right?) are all actions of caring. And each of these actions are stepping stones that create a path for helping to build families. Erica: Nursing and surrogacy have allowed me to fulfill my calling of helping build families whether it’s through support in labor and delivery or the postpartum period or being entrusted to carry someone’s precious gift as a surrogate. Kristina: I like to think that as a surrogate I was able to lighten the load of worries for each of my three sets of intended parents. It enabled me to bring happiness into their lives. As an employee of ConceiveAbilities these past 12 years, I’ve been able to care for surrogates through the education and support I have provided throughout their application process. Nicole: As a ConceiveAbilities employee, I know that we are all working together to care for our surrogates and intended parents as they go through one of life’s biggest moments. Happy Nurse Appreciation Week to all nurses, and especially to Kelly, Erica, Kristina, Nicole, and all of our nurses on the ConceiveAbilities staff! Inspired by our nurses?

Whether you are a new mother who is breastfeeding or you are a lactating surrogate who is preparing to ship breast milk to intended parents, you may be wondering how to ship breast milk. Working moms traveling for business may also find it beneficial to ship their milk home. No matter your reasons for wanting to ship breast milk, our team can help. We put together a comprehensive guide on how to mail breast milk effectively and safely, including some important do’s and don’ts on mailing breast milk, ensuring your milk arrives in the best condition while you focus on how to maintain and increase milk supply. Steps to Shipping Breast Milk First, select an insulated shipping container. You can search on platforms like Amazon for a container that is leakproof and structurally sound for transport. Collect your breast milk. First, label durable, BPA-free bags, bottles, or pouches with the date. Then, use a breast pump to fill them with milk, remove the excess air, and seal them. Be prepared to freeze them as soon as you finish this step.Pro Tip: As you’re filling your bags/bottles/pouches, leave some room in them; the milk will expand when frozen. Otherwise, they will burst. Once the milk is frozen, pack the breast milk in your insulated box as tightly as possible. The milk should go into the box first, then the other items to cool and insulate it. Shipping a smaller amount of milk? You can nestle it between layers of ice packs.Pro Tip: If the milk doesn’t fill the box, you’ll want to strategically load up the rest of the box. Add in packing material such as newspaper and then put the frozen gel packs or ice packs on top, cover it with a plastic bag, and then seal it in the box. Want even more peace of mind? Include a temperature monitoring device within your shipment, which can ensure the milk maintains a safe temperature. Finish packaging the shipment by taping it up with duct tape and labeling it. Label requirements may differ across courier services, so inquire about additional information if needed. There are additional methods for packing up your breast milk. For instance, you can use thick-walled Styrofoam coolers and cardboard boxes. Simply store your breast milk storage bags in the cooler and place them in the cardboard box or shipping box. Make sure to choose a cooler that is not too large but is large enough for the ice packs, insulation material, and breast milk.

    "content": "How Long Should You Supply Breast Milk to Intended Parents? As a surrogate, you might be considering providing breast milk postpartum for your intended parents and wondering how to maintain and increase milk supply during this time. his will be a shared decision between you and your intended parents to choose what is best for you, based on what works best for everyone involved. Ultimately, there is no one correct answer to this question; however, there are numerous factors to consider, including the methods you’ll use to maintain and increase milk supply effectively. Assessing Intended Parent Needs The length of time in which you provide breast milk is a shared decision between the surrogate and the intended parents. It will depend on how long the intended parents want breast milk and how long you, as the surrogate, wants to pump. Together, you will decide what the optimal length of time you will provide breast milk. Because breast milk offers a host of health benefits, your intended parents may want it for as long as possible. Newborn babies will not require as much milk; however, as they grow, they will become hungrier and need a larger amount of milk. That being said, the more you pump, the more your body produces. If you are not providing breast milk for your intended family, the intended mother can also breastfeed. Should they need breastfeeding support, they can utilize a Supplemental Nursing System (SNS). Another option is formula feeding. If your intended family does not choose to have you provide breast milk for their baby, you may choose to suppress lactation. You may also choose to continue your giving journey and donate your breast milk. Assessing Surrogate Needs Additionally, you must also consider how long you, as a surrogate, would want to provide breast milk. You have your own unique milk supply you can offer to the baby, but pumping can be a time-consuming, physically challenging, and emotionally challenging process. You may even experience irritation and soreness through your pumping journey. Plus, if you are not local to your intended parents, you will need to evaluate how often you will need to ship breast milk to them. Here are some tips from lactation expert Lenna Gregory on How to Pump, Ship and Donate Your Breast Milk. Understanding The Breast Milk Pumping Timeline If you are still thinking about how long to provide breast milk, gaining a better understanding of the general pumping timeline can be helpful. During Pregnancy & The First Days Milk production begins as soon as the second trimester; your body starts producing colostrum, the first type of breast milk in preparation for providing nourishment after birth. After delivery, you will begin to pump breast milk, and you will be providing transitional milk for about a couple weeks, which is when mature milk typically comes in.As far as baby feeds go, at first, feeding sessions will likely be every two to three hours, though these can start to spread out after the baby’s first week. Keep in mind that, during this time, babies will go through cluster feeding phases. The First Month to 6 Months Old Exclusive breast milk is recommended for the first six months of an infant’s life. Babies will go through growth spurts during this time and may continue to cluster feed. After this time period, they can continue to have breast milk with the introduction of solid foods through their first year or so How to Maintain and Increase Your Milk Supply To maintain and increase your milk supply while pumping breast milk, it’s essential to pump regularly, ideally every 2-3 hours, to effectively mimic your baby’s natural feeding schedule. Using a high-quality breast pump with the correct flange size ensures efficient milk extraction, which helps maintain and increase your milk supply. Staying hydrated, eating a balanced diet, and reducing stress also play a significant role in supporting your milk production. Additionally, incorporating gentle breast massage can stimulate milk flow, further helping to maintain and increase your milk supply. If challenges arise, consulting a lactation consultant can provide tailored advice to optimize your pumping routine.

So, When Is The Right Time? Deciding on the length of time you will provide breast milk is a personal decision. When it comes to their little one, no matter if they are with breast milk, formula, or both, as the saying goes, “fed is best”. Have additional questions about breastfeeding and breast milk?

    "content": "The world of surrogacy is changing rapidly. Yet, not all the words and terms are keeping pace. ConceiveAbilities is committed to refining our process to not only keep up with, but continuing to lead the surrogacy world. And what we hear A LOT from surrogates and intended mothers and families alike, is a simple truth. They do not like to be called a surrogate mother. The term surrogate mother is outdated, even when well-intentioned…and most importantly, not a true representation of modern surrogacy. The surrogate, or gestational carrier, is not the mother. Period. She shares no DNA or genetic relation to the child she is carrying. She will have undergone IVF treatment to receive the embryo of the intended parents; that embryo will have been created with the intended parents’ and/or donor egg and sperm. As one surrogate shared, she is the babysitter, not the mother. We surveyed our experienced surrogates about the term surrogate mother. 80% said they feel the term mother should be dropped completely. Here is what they say you need to know: The surrogate is not the mother.The surrogate is in no way genetically related to the child she is carrying. She does not share any DNA with the child she is carrying. The child a surrogate carries is the intended parent(s)’ child. “I am not the mother of the baby at all,” says surrogate Teale Kelley. Elizabeth Foley says dropping the term “mother” removes the parental feel, saying “I’m just the babysitter until the baby can go home to his parents.” Mother should be saved for the mom.Women become a surrogate to help another person experience the joys of parenthood. They know this is not their baby and they want to ensure that the mother of the child receives the proper title. Samantha Smith feels the word “mother” takes away from the intended mom because “she is still the mother even if she is not carrying the child and should be recognized as so.“ Another surrogate shares, “The mother may already feel that she is losing a lot by needing to use a surrogate and calling someone a surrogate mother can affect the actual mother’s feelings.” It feeds into surrogate myths.Many surrogates think the word mother confuses people and further feeds surrogacy myths and misconceptions. Two-time surrogate Melissa Enke says using the term “mother” makes people think the baby was partially hers. Another surrogate says it leads to the question “how do you not feel horrible giving up a baby?” adding, “I’m not giving up the child, because I’m never the parent.” Elizabeth Foley also feels that the term “mother” leads to questions about her keeping the baby, “Other than the fact that it is actually the largest contract violation, this concept of wanting to keep the baby is inaccurate. Continuing to use the term surrogate mother will cause these misperceptions to carry on and prevent the public from being properly educated on the truly complex process that is gestational surrogacy.” It can be damaging.Oftentimes, intended parents have had an extremely challenging infertility journey and referring to the surrogate as a mother can be hurtful. Through surrogacy, they are able to build their family with a trusted partner. One surrogate shared, “It’s important to me that I am not viewed as the mother. The term mother should be reserved for the actual mother.” Molly Corcoran says she is already planning ahead for her next delivery saying, “I had a delivery at the hospital where I was being called mom by the clinical staff and I had to correct them multiple times. My next journey I put in the birth plan that was given to the hospital to refer to me by my first name.” The surrogate is just the babysitter. She is not the mother.As the number one surrogacy myth, It’s worth repeating. To put a complex matter in a cute way: it is the surrogate’s oven, but not their bun. That said, surrogates are caring and nurturing women. Deanna Mitchell says, “As a surrogate, you care for the baby you are carrying as if it were your own, to substitute as best as possible for how the intended mother would love and care for her baby if she were able to carry it on her own.” 100% of the women we surveyed said they prefer to be called a surrogate, gestational surrogate or gestational carrier (“GC”) without the word mother. So why do we still use the term “Surrogate Mother” on our website? Because we want to share surrogacy with as many people as we possibly can to help grow families. Hear us out. Our research indicates that over 1.3 million women in the United States would be both willing and qualified to be surrogates – if they were educated and knowledgeable about the topic. For those women that are at the earliest stages of learning about surrogacy, they frequently use the term “Surrogate Mother” to search for information about surrogacy. In fact, “Surrogate Mother” is the third highest used search term people use while learning about surrogacy. Following closely behind are these phrases: “What is A Surrogate Mother,” “Surrogate Mother Meaning” and “Surrogate Mother Definition.” Surrogacy can be complex when someone is first introduced to it. Because our goal is to be a leading resource for people who want to learn more about surrogacy, we do use the term “Surrogate Mother” with the intention of helping them get the best information so they can make an informed decision. And, once we have their attention, we help them learn why this particular term is one to be left in the rearview mirror. Curious about how you can help build families by being a surrogate?

The impacts of this shortage still persist. “In our work to help build families for more than twenty-five years, we know that many women find purpose in helping other families at a time of great need,” shared Founder Nazca Fontes, adding, “Like surrogacy, milk banks play a vital role in supporting families. We stand ready to assist all women who are able to help lift up other women, mothers, and families and help provide much needed nutrition to their babies. While there is – yet still – so much work to be done to address the infant formula shortage, we hope an increase of breast milk donations will be a lifeline for these families at this critical time.” Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services, adds, “Our surrogates are incredibly giving and often donate their breast milk after their surrogacy journey. By inspiring more women to donate, we hope those who are facing this uncertainty can rest easy at night knowing they can provide critical nutrition for their babies.” More Resources for Lactating Women: Do you need help finding lactation consultant services?

    "content": "What Is The Definition of Infertility The American Society of Reproduction (ASRM) has redefined infertility to be inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. Infertility is defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner and is inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. In patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at six months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. Nothing in this definition shall be used to deny or delay treatment to any individual, regardless of relationship status or sexual orientation. There are many fertility treatments available for people experiencing infertility: the most successful being surrogacy. Redefining Infertility to Celebrate Every Surrogacy Journey The broadened infertility definition opens doors for more same-sex couples and single individuals to access assisted reproductive technologies, marking a beacon of hope and opportunity. This change is particularly significant, given that some insurance plans rely on ASRM’s definition of infertility to approve fertility treatments. Learn more about infertility. We Are Proud of Our History Helping Hundreds of LGTBQ+ and Single People Have Families As a pioneering surrogacy agency committed to supporting all who aspire to build a family, ConceiveAbilities applauds a groundbreaking development in the United States. The official definition of infertility has undergone a significant expansion, offering newfound hope and opportunities to a wider range of individuals, particularly within the LGBTQ+ community and among single parents. ConceiveAbilities Founder Nazca Fontes, a passionate advocate for modern family-building, enthusiastically lauds the latest initiative by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). This move recognizes and caters to the unique needs of same-sex and single parent communities, marking a monumental step toward inclusivity in the field of reproductive health. “We have always believed everyone who wants to be a parent should be able to. Over our 27 year history, we have assisted hundreds of LGBTQ+ and single people achieve their dreams of parenthood. We wholeheartedly commend ASRM’s latest development in recognizing the need to modernize the definition to include same-sex and single parent communities.” Surrogate Whitney Anderson says this change is a glimmer of hope for all LGBTQ+ families, saying, “I became a surrogatespecifically to help an LGBTQ+ family and I am honored to help them start their family. This new definition for infertility will allow more people to fulfill their dreams of parenthood.” According to Dr. Mark Leondires, Medical Director of Illume Fertility and Founder of Gay Parents To Be, this is a significant step forward for the LGBTQ+ community. He states, “It is a personal passion of mine to help move the needle for the LGBTQ+ community to be able to have children who are an expression of somebody’s love for their partner. As a gay dad myself, I understand how hard it is to get started on a surrogacy journey. This new definition of infertility makes it all the more possible.” The New Inclusive Infertility Definition Makes Parenthood a Reality for LGBTQ+ and Single Communities “Every person, regardless of marital status or sexual preference, with the desire to become a parent should have equal access to the benefits and opportunities to safely and effectively build their family. Today’s definition makes this a reality,” details Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services for ConceiveAbilities. This crucial decision is designed to offer vital support to same-sex couples and single individuals who have encountered barriers to their fertility treatment claims, marking a step toward a more inclusive and compassionate approach to reproductive health and family-building for all. ConceiveAbilities proudly supports and commends this progressive change. ConceiveAbilities is proudly certified by the Family Equality Council as an official Open Door LGBTQ+ family building agency.

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, where I metmy husband in high school. After high school my husband joined the Air Force and I followed him toCalifornia. There we had our amazing son, Isaac, who is 8 years old and our wonderfully sweetdaughter, Harper, who is almost 6. We are growing our roots here in Colorado and loving it. As afamily we enjoy hiking the mountains and playing board games. My personal hobbies include cooking,baking, and creating art. CHRISTINA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY Becoming a gestational surrogate wasn’t a decision I took lightly; it was the culmination of a deepdesire to help others experience the joy of parenthood. My journey into surrogacy began with a simplethought: What if I could be the one to make someone’s dream of having a child come true? Read more about Christina’s decision to become a surrogate not only once, but twice! WHAT MAKES CHRISTINA COURAGEOUS In a world that often seems divided, my journey as a gestational surrogate has taught me that thegreatest gift we can give one another is the gift of love and compassion. It’s about reaching out to helpthose in need, even if they are strangers, and uniting in the beautiful journey of creating families. CHRISTINA’S PURPOSE: The birth of my two children were single handedly the best days of my life. Both of my children’spregnancies were very much planned for and wanted and watching them grow and become their ownpeople is such a rewarding experience. The idea that a friend or family member may go without theamazing, humbling experience of parenthood when they deeply desired it was heartbreaking. Howcould I not step up to help them if I was able? One day while I was browsing the internet an ad forConceiveabilities popped up and I quickly discovered that this selfless act extended beyond ourimmediate circles. I realized that I could help complete strangers on their path to parenthood, and thisrevelation was truly life-changing. If I would help a friend, why was a stranger any different?

    "content": "As told by Brelani Jiminez, ConceiveAbilities Surrogate Why did you decide to become a surrogate?I decided to become a surrogate because of two main reasons: I naturally had easy pregnancies/deliveries and I had a desire to share the indescribable feeling when I held my babies for the first time. I decided that I would love to provide this moment for another couple who has been desiring the opportunity to hold their own babies for so long. What role did your faith play into your decision?After many years of research, discussions with mentors and a lot of prayer, my husband and I decided to pursue surrogacy for many reasons. We think of this journey as adding to our testimony of how beautiful our God is. We had a feeling coming into this that our Intended Parents would have already had a hard and difficult journey. We prayed God would place us in a position to be a beacon of light and a vessel for the Holy Spirit for not only our intended parents, but for all of those that we would come in contact with along the way. We wanted to be a glimmer of hope and light in what would feel like a dark world – and to have the opportunity to share the love of Jesus to a complete stranger, for it is mentioned in the Bible in Acts 20:35, “In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’” To show others that when science and all that mankind can provide has put everything on the table, there is nothing else to credit besides God. How did you share your decision to become a surrogate with your religious community?I decided to share my journey with all (those who are followers of Jesus Christ and those who are not) via social media and by word of mouth. We made this decision to publicly share so that others may find hope in dark places. I love to provide transparency and show others how God has worked absolute wonders in my life and continues to do so everyday. I haven’t had the easiest journey as I envisioned having my first transfer being successful. While my journey has actually been a bit difficult, I have been able to publicly show the many ups and downs throughout this part of my life. How God has helped carry me through has been such a blessing. All of what we have been through and continue to go through will be to bring honor and glory to God. How do you handle negative comments regarding your decision to become a surrogate?I haven’t had many negative comments regarding my decision to become a surrogate, but I have had a lot of questions brought to my attention. The one negative reaction I can recall was from another Christian who told me that she had a message from God. She shared that surrogacy is the way of this world and to turn my focus on God to share His love and light in other ways. She went on to suggest that the idea of me partaking in surrogacy was a role of “playing God.” The message ended with God understanding where my heart is upon this action and He values this; however, the action is incorrect and taking on the ways of this world. When she shared this message, I was heartbroken and distraught for quite a while. As many other Christians would agree, I would never want to violate the will of God, let alone dive right into disobedience head first. My intentions were to never attempt to “play God.” My reasoning to pursue surrogacy was the exact opposite; to share the gospel and His love for His children. I wanted to be a light for God in a dark world filled with hurt and brokenness. Through prayer, reading scripture, meditation, application and some extra prayers, I have come to the realization there will be naysayers, there will be messengers, there will be those who doubt this is the correct way of God’s will. In the end I remember this: my relationship with Jesus Christ and doing the work of the Lord comes down to me, myself, and God. Was it important for you to match with intended parents of the same faith?It was not as important for me to match with intended parents of the same faith; however, it is important to me to abide and align myself with what Biblical principles describe as a couple. Being open to all intended parents no matter their faith while aligning within Biblical principles provides an opportunity for me to love God’s children, to share the light with those who are willing to listen, and hopefully plant a seed in leading them to Christ. What would be your one message to potential surrogates struggling with this decision because of their faith?My one message to women struggling with this decision because of their faith would be: take the leap of faith. Let this be a testimony to God and allow an opportunity to show how powerful and all-knowing He is. As long as your heart posture is in the right place, becoming a surrogate is not an attempt of going against God’s will because, in the end, God still has complete control over all including the results of your surrogacy journey. What better way to demonstrate a glimpse of our Living Hope than to be a vessel for the Holy Spirit and provide a blessing to another couple in a way that could never truly be reciprocated. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family?

    "content": "U.S. Surrogacy Laws By State By Fran Caruso, Esq. ConceiveAbilities is your trusted resource for all things surrogacy including guidance through the legal process. Surrogacy laws vary from state to state and even sometimes county to county. That is why, in addition to our own internal team of expert attorneys, ConceiveAbilities partners with local, state specific attorneys who specialize in reproductive law. Surrogacy laws are ever-changing, but we are here to ensure you feel informed, comfortable, and assured as you proceed forward with the legal process. Below is a brief overview of the current laws impacting surrogacy in relevant states. We are always here to provide additional information and answer your questions so that you can feel confident from the legal perspective as you embark on a surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities. Illinois Illinois is ConceiveAbilities’ home base! In Illinois, gestational surrogacy is permitted via statute and allows intended parents(s) to be declared the legal parent(s) upon birth of the child as long as one intended parent is a genetic contributor to the child. As such, legal parentage is determined upon birth and intended parents can obtain a birth certificate from vital statistics directly. If the statute’s requirements are not met, or if a court order is needed for other reasons, then parentage may be determined via a post-birth order. Finally, if both egg donor and sperm donor are used, parental rights would be obtained via an adoption proceeding.Get more information about surrogacy in Illinois. New York As of February 15, 2021, compensated gestational surrogacy was made legal in New York via its new statute: the Child Parent Security Act (CPSA). The CPSA includes the Surrogate’s Bill of Rights–the first of its kind in the industry–as well as many requirements for the gestational carrier agreements. You can learn more about the CPSA and its impact on the surrogacy industry here.Notably, ConceiveAbilities was one of the first surrogacy agencies to be licensed by the New York Department of Health. To comply with the CPSA, ConceiveAbilities ensures that its intended parents and gestational carriers have experienced, well-versed reproductive attorneys who are knowledgeable of the CPSA. Under the CPSA, New York courts will grant pre-birth orders for all intended parents regardless of genetic contributors, marital status, or sexual orientation who are parties to a compensated surrogacy arrangement; and the order will go into effect at the time of the birth.Get more information about surrogacy in New York. Colorado Gestational surrogacy is legal in Colorado via the Colorado Surrogacy Agreement Act. The law protects both the intended parents and the gestational carrier who have entered into gestational carrier agreements consistent with the law. ConceiveAbilities ensures that during the drafting of the gestational carrier agreement all parties are represented by attorneys licensed in Colorado as is required by the law. Intended parents can proceed with a gestational carrier in Colorado regardless of their marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or need for surrogacy. Parentage can be determined via a pre-birth order from the juvenile court and said order will vest the intended parents with all parental rights and duties to the child immediately upon birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Colorado. California California is often thought of as the “friendliest” state for surrogacy and for good reason—California was the first state to enact a statute that makes surrogacy available to all! And while there are other states that are similarly as supportive and legally secure, California remains one of the most sought after states for surrogacy. Intended Parents, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy, can obtain a pre-birth order. This is true so long as any portion of the surrogacy occurred in California–specifically: (1) the county where the child is anticipated to be born, (2) the county where the intended parent(s) reside, (3) the county where the gestational carrier resides, (4) the county where the assisted reproduction agreement for gestational carrier is executed, or (5) the county where medical procedures pursuant to the GCA (i.e. embryo transfers) are to be performed. The pre-birth order becomes effective at the moment of birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Southern California and Northern California Oregon Although there are no specific surrogacy laws in Oregon, there are laws that contemplate the relationship between the intended parent(s) and a child conceived via assisted reproductive technology. Furthermore, there are no specific statutes or case law that prohibit surrogacy. Surrogacy is safely practiced in Oregon and is available to any and all types of intended parents who will legally be declared the parents of the child. Most judges issue pre-birth orders if there is a genetic connection between the intended parent(s) and child and in some cases even when there is not a genetic connection. Post-birth orders are also available if needed.Get more information about surrogacy in Oregon. Washington Rounding out the surrogacy friendly states of the west coast is Washington. As of January 1, 2019, Washington enacted a parentage statute that provides for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders. Pre-birth orders are granted regardless of the intended parent(s) marital status, sexual preference, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy. Pre-birth orders go into effect upon the birth of the child. Washington law defines who can be a “gestational surrogate” and provides specific details as to what terms need to be included in the gestational carrier for it to be enforceable. Specifically, a gestational carrier may not have completed more than two (2) surrogacies.Therefore, for all parties’ protection, it is critical that intended parents and gestational carriers work with experienced surrogacy professionals, like those at ConceiveAbilities, who are well versed in the specific requirements in Washington.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington. Minnesota Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Minnesota as no statute or published case law prohibits surrogacy. Surrogacy is available to Intended Parents regardless of marital status or genetic connection. Although many courts in several counties will grant pre-birth declaratory judgments, the more likely course of action is that parentage will be determined post-birth, especially if donor material was used. The relevant paperwork can be filed pre-birth, but it will not be granted until after birth. Additionally, a hearing is oftentimes required by the presiding judge meaning that all parties should anticipate remaining in Minnesota until the necessary legal work is completed. Arguably the most notable aspect of surrogacy in Minnesota is that if a judge will not sign a pre-birth declaratory judgment, a non-genetic parent will need to obtain a second parent adoption post-birth to confer parental rights. While the optics of this is not ideal, as it is the intended parents’ child, it is a critical step to ensure that all intended parents have equal legal rights to their child. The second parent adoption is typically completed quickly after birth in conjunction with the other post-birth legal proceedings in order to ensure both parents are named on the birth certificate.Get more information about surrogacy in Minnesota. Massachusetts Gestational surrogacy is supported in Massachusetts by three notable cases decided by the Commonwealth’s superior Court – Hodas v. Morin (2004); Culliton v. Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr. (2002); and R.R. v. M.H. (1998). Married and unmarried couples and single individuals, regardless of sexual orientation and/or genetic connection, may obtain a pre-birth order. A hearing is typically not required but is ultimately up to the judge’s discretion.Get more information about surrogacy in Massachusetts. Nevada Not to be outdone by its neighboring state of California, Nevada also has a surrogacy statute that permits gestational surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need. Pre-birth and post-birth orders are available. The Nevada statute specifically provides that parties may enter into gestational carrier agreements which contemplate payment of consideration for surrogacy services. The statute also requires that the gestational carrier agreement expressly state that the gestational carrier and her legal spouse/partner relinquish all rights and duties to the child conceived through assisted reproduction and that it is the intended parent(s) who are the parents of any resulting child. While the gestational carrier agreement would already state this regardless of the prevailing state law, Nevada has appropriately made this a statutory requirement for any gestational carrier agreement. Way to go Nevada!Get more information about surrogacy in Nevada. Pennsylvania Although there is no surrogacy statute in Pennsylvania, gestational surrogacy is still permitted and practiced. Pennsylvania declared in a 2006 case that a surrogacy contract is not contrary to public policy and that the gestational carrier is not the “legal mother.” Furthermore, in 2015, the Superior Court confirmed the enforceability of gestational carrier agreements as well as intended parents legal parentage to the child regardless of any genetic connection. Pre-birth orders are available, although this sometimes varies based on the specific county and judge, particularly if donor material is used. However, thanks to these court decisions, parties can safely proceed with gestational surrogacy in Pennsylvania.Get more information about surrogacy in Pennsylvania. Maryland Maryland has been a favorable state for gestational surrogacy since 2003. Similar to other states, parties are able to safely practice gestational surrogacy thanks to a favorable court decision (as compared to an explicit statute). Maryland’s highest court implicitly approved gestational surrogacy by determining that a gestational carrier is not required to be listed as the “mother” on the birth certificate of the child thereby leading to having the intended parents exclusively listed. Regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection, Intended Parents are able to establish their parental rights pre-birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Maryland. Georgia Despite no statutory or case law directly addressing surrogacy contracts in Georgia, it is a favorable state for gestational surrogacy. Courts regularly establish parental rights for Intended Parents through a pre-birth declaratory judgment regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic connection (although there may be additional paperwork required). The court process is typically very seamless – everything is usually handled directly between attorneys and usually no in-person hearing is required, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Georgia. Virginia Many are surprised to learn that surrogacy is authorized by statute in Virginia. Virginia’s “Status of Children of Assisted Conception” is unique because although it contemplates court approval process, this can only be done prior to embryo transfer and is not a pre-birth parentage order. It is instead a lengthy court process more akin to an adoption proceeding–home studies for all parties, the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the unborn child, and a full trial-like court hearing. Therefore, almost all Intended Parents bypass this and opt to establish their parental rights post-birth either through the administrative process contemplated in the statute or an order of parentage from the court. One other unique note for Virginia, the gestational carrier cannot sign any of the documents until 72 hours after the child is born. Finally, Virginia has a marital requirement for couples pursuing gestational surrogacy, but there need not be any genetic connection so long as ownership of the embryo can be proven. Ohio As of 2007, the Ohio Supreme Court has confirmed that gestational surrogacy is not against public policy and therefore gestational surrogacy is readily practiced in Ohio. While pre-birth orders are granted, they are discretionary meaning they are somewhat variable depending on the county. However, most counties will issue a pre-birth order for married Intended Parents, unmarried heterosexual couples, or singles regardless of sexual orientation or genetics. If not possible, Intended Parents can obtain a post-birth order to secure their parental rights.Get more information about surrogacy in Ohio. North Carolina Gestational surrogacy is practiced in North Carolina as there is no prohibition of it by either case law or statute. While most intended parents are able to obtain a pre-birth parentage, in some rare occasions parentage may be determined post-birth. The biggest factor is the intended parents’ marital status and genetic connection to the child. One specificity as to North Carolina gestational surrogacy is that when a known donor is used, the donor will also to be a party to the parentage legal proceedings. Nevertheless, single genetic parents, married and unmarried heterosexual couples with at least one genetic parent, and married same-sex couples with one genetic parent traditionally have no issue obtaining pre-birth orders as a matter of course.Get more information about surrogacy in North Carolina. Alabama Alabama courts regularly recognize gestational surrogacy and establish parental rights for married couples and single Intended Parents regardless of genetic connection. More often than not, Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth declaratory judgment; in cases where that is not allowed (based on the county), Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth consent which becomes effective five days after delivery of the child. Ultimately, a post birth order may be necessary.Get more information about surrogacy in Alabama. Florida In Florida, gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Ch.742.15 FL Stat.) but only for married couples. However, surrogacy is still available to unmarried and single Intended Parents in Florida via court orders so long as one Intended Parent has a genetic connection. Although technically providing pre-birth orders, Florida is unique in that the pre-birth orders act more as interim orders for medical decisions and paternity. A post birth order must be obtained before a birth certificate containing the Intended Parents’ names will be issued. Florida also has a strict medical need requirement with the statute providing specific medical requirements such as the Intended Mother is not able to physically gestate a pregnancy to term.Get more information about surrogacy in Florida. New Jersey In 2018, the Gestational Carrier Agreement Act went into effect in New Jersey. The Act provided for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders for all types of Intended Parents in accordance with specific conditions. For example, the gestational carrier agreement must be in writing, all parties must have completed mental health evaluations, and independent legal representation must have been provided for the gestational carrier and Intended Parents. These requirements and protections make New Jersey a very surrogacy friendly state.Get more information about surrogacy in New Jersey. Texas By statute, Texas permits gestational surrogacy for married intended parents (Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 160.752, § 160.753, § 160.754). Under the law, the “gestational agreement” (aka GCA) must be validated by the court to be enforceable and confer parental rights. If the parties have a validated gestational carrier agreement, married Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth order. For Intended Parents who are not married, or those who are single, judges have the discretion to grant pre-birth orders. The Texas statute also contemplates the option of a post-birth order. Regardless of pre-birth or post-birth, there must be a genetic connection between the IPs and the child. For unmarried IPs, the non-genetic parent would need to complete a second parent adoption. One unique aspect of the Texas law is that the gestational carrier agreement needs to be validated to be enforceable.Get more information about surrogacy in Texas. Wisconsin Wisconsin’s Supreme Court ruled in the 2013 case of Paternity of F.T.R., Rosecky v. Schissel that surrogacy contracts are enforceable so long as they are not contrary to the best interests of the child. Typically, intended parents, regardless of marital status, can obtain parentage orders placing their names on the birth certificate so long as one parent is genetically related to the child. If neither intended parent is genetically related to the child, a parentage order may be granted but this will depend on the particular county and judge. Additionally, while parentage orders are often issued pre-birth, they are considered “interim” orders and require a subsequent, final order issued after the child’s birth to facilitate obtaining the birth certificate. Finally, in many cases a hearing is required where all parties may be expected to appear.Get more information about surrogacy in Wisconsin. Connecticut The Connecticut Parentage Act (CPA) provides a protected path to parentage for any intended parents pursuing gestational surrogacy. The CPA ensures that all Connecticut children – regardless of the circumstances of their birth or the marital status, gender, or sexual orientation of their parents – have equal access to the security of a legal parent-child relationship. Furthermore, Connecticut has a statute that requires Vital Records to comply with court orders in issuing a birth certificate naming the intended parents in a gestational surrogacy arrangement as the parents. Parentage orders are granted pre-birth, but an in-person healing with all parties (intended parents, gestational carrier, and gestational carrier spouse) tends to be required.Get more information about surrogacy in Connecticut. Indiana At first blush, Indiana may not seem like an ideal state for surrogacy as there is a statute that voids gestational carrier agreements. However, Indiana attorneys advise that said statute only applies to traditional surrogacy (where the surrogate is genetically related to the child), not gestational surrogacy. For added protection, gestational carrier agreements, where the gestational carrier resides in Indiana will likely be drafted using the state law where the Intended Parents or fertility clinic are located. Nonetheless, gestational surrogacy is widely practiced in Indiana and courts regularly grant parental rights via pre and post birth parentage orders to married Intended Parents who have some genetic connection to the child. Single intended parents may also obtain a pre-birth order if genetically related to the child, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Indiana. Washington, D.C.Our nation’s capital has an express surrogacy statute. DC statutes (DC Law §§ 16-401 – 16-412) provide that all Intended Parents can obtain pre-birth orders establishing their parentage regardless of genetic connection, marital status, sexual orientation or need for surrogacy. Said orders do not become effective until the moment of birth and either the intended parents or gestational carrier need to have resided in DC for at least one (1) year. If neither party meets the residency requirement, a post-birth order can be obtained.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington, DC. Alaska With no case law or statute prohibiting surrogacy, gestational surrogacy is permitted and practiced in Alaska. It is generally anticipated that courts will establish parentage pre-birth for intended parents regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic link to the expected child, but due to limited surrogacy matters in the area, it is best pursued by heterosexual parents who are married using embryos with their own genetics. A hearing is most likely required and all parties may be ordered to appear with most cases being filed and heard in Anchorage. Arizona Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Arizona pursuant to a 1994 appellate court decision (Soos v. Superior Court) and courts acknowledge certain parental rights via court order. Some courts will allow pre-birth orders, but many courts wait until after the birth of the child before entering a maternity order. An intended father who is the biological contributor can be listed on the birth certificate without any order through the use of a paternity affidavit in conjunction with a denial of paternity affidavit by the gestational carrier’s husband if the gestational carrier is married.Notably, surrogacy contracts are unenforceable and prohibited by statute (Arizona Revised Statute § 25-218). So how do the parties lay out the terms of their agreement? Most commonly, in lieu of Arizona law, the prevailing law of the gestational carrier agreement will be that of another state that has a connection to the surrogacy arrangement, not Arizona; this state is most commonly California. If there is a California connection to the surrogacy (e.g. one Party lives in CA or the Fertility Center is located in CA), the Parties can also bypass court proceedings in Arizona and instead obtain a court order from California. These court orders are routinely accepted by Arizona hospitals and Vital Records.Ultimately, there are several nuances with the Arizona process which is why it is critical to work with an experienced assisted reproduction technology attorney that is knowledgeable of the Arizona process. Arkansas Surrogacy is statutorily permitted in Arkansas (Code § 9-10-201) and there is flexibility in the establishment of parental rights with married intended parents able to obtain pre-birth orders. However, unmarried intended parents who create embryos with donor material will require a second parent adoption in their home state as only the biological parent can obtain a pre-birth order. Furthermore, pursuant to the statute, vital records shall initially list the gestational carrier on the birth certificate documents and then permanently amend such records to name the intended parents as the true legal parents; even when a pre-birth order has been issued. Delaware Delaware may be small but it sure is mighty when it comes to surrogacy. Gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Delaware Code 13, § 8-801 – § 8-810) for any and all IPs regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, and genetic relationship to the child. Parentage is established pre-birth and the statute explicitly provides that the gestational carrier is “not a parent of a child born as a result of a gestational carrier arrangement” so long as specified requirements are met in the arrangement. Hawaii There is no existing statute or case law in Hawaii that prohibits surrogacy so it is freely practiced so long as there is a genetic connection between the intended parents and the child. If the embryo was created with the assistance of an egg or sperm donor, the non-biological parent must complete a second parent adoption either in Hawaii or their home state, in order for the child’s birth certificate to show them both as the parents. For the non-biological parent, parentage can only be established post-birth. However, a hearing for the parentage order typically requires at least the gestational carrier and her spouse, if applicable, to attend in person. Idaho As of July 1, 2023, Idaho Gestational Agreements Act went into effect making Idaho a favorable state for surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection. Under the new law, the parties can file a petition to have their gestational carrier agreement validated pre-birth which in turn makes it enforceable under the statute. Upon finding that the gestational carrier agreement is valid, the court shall issue an order validating the agreement and declaring that the intended parents are/will be the parent(s) of any child born under the terms of the agreement. Then post-birth, the court will issue a validation order and an order of parentage confirming that the intended parents are the parent(s) of the child. Iowa Surrogacy is implicitly permitted in Iowa from a culmination of three legal premises: (1) Iowa Code provides that surrogacy agreements are exempt from Iowa’s law prohibiting the purchase or sale of an individual, (2) Iowa’s administrative code addresses the issuance of birth certificates for children born to a gestational carrier (Iowa Admin. Code r. 641-99.15(144)), and (3) the Iowa Supreme Court held in 2018 that gestational carrier agreements are enforceable and do not violate public policy or the constitutional rights of the gestational carrier or child (P.M. & C.M. v. T.B. & D.B). Furthermore, in the same case, the court stated that gestational carrier agreements “promote families by enabling infertile couples to raise their own children and help bring new life into this world through willing surrogate mothers.”As a result of this, parentage in Iowa is established in two (2) parts. First, parentage is only to be established before birth for the biological father, resulting in a birth certificate listing the biological father with gestational carrier. Then post-birth a second order is necessary to permanently change the child’s birth certificate to list the second parent. This second order is either a parentage order for the other genetic parent or an adoption for a non-genetic parent. Have you thought about becoming a surrogate?

    "content": "By Ashtin Gurevitz, a Two-Time Surrogate and ConceiveAbilities Surrogate Intake Manager Surrogacy has always been my calling. I knew I wanted to help someone have a family since I can remember. When I started dating my husband, who is also my high school sweetheart, I let him know becoming a surrogate was part of my plan. After completing our own beautiful family of three children, we decided the time was right. I knew my gift of surrogacy would change someone’s life, but I never dreamed it would change my life like it has. Matching with My Intended Parents Matching was the most important thing for me and my family. Matching with Brian and Scott, a loving gay couple from New York, was a dream come true. I always knew I wanted to work with a same-sex couple, and our connection was instant. I still get emotional about our first meeting. Throughout the pregnancy, Brian and Scott were amazing intended parents. We communicated regularly, and they visited us during important milestones. Their involvement made the journey feel like a shared experience, strengthening our bond that will last a lifetime. The Birth The day of delivery is the moment every surrogate dreams of. It’s hard to even put the excitement into words. I was surrounded by my husband, Jeff, who is my biggest cheerleader, and my best friend, Hannah, a birthing photographer who was capturing every moment. My focus was on Brian and Scott, who were there to witness the arrival of their son, Silas. When Silas was born, the emotions in the room were overwhelming. Seeing the happiness and love in Brian and Scott’s eyes was a moment I will cherish forever. I am so grateful to have these photos and video of this incredible moment. The Sibling Journey The journey did not end there. Soon after delivering Silas, I decided to do a sibling surrogacy journey with Brian and Scott, carrying their second child, Sloane, who completed their family. Becoming a surrogate has been a transformational experience for me. It has taught me the power of giving. Knowing that I played a part in building a family has left an indelible mark on my heart. Sharing Surrogacy Now I work at ConceiveAbilities to help other women fulfill their calling of becoming a surrogate. It is a unique opportunity to create a family, forge lifelong connections, and experience the magic of childbirth in a profound way. To anyone considering surrogacy, I encourage you to embrace the journey with an open heart and mind. There may be challenges, but the reward of witnessing a family come together is priceless. Surrogacy has changed my life in ways I could have never imagined, and I will forever be grateful for this incredible experience. Learn more about becoming a surrogate.

    "content": "When talking about surrogacy laws in New York, it is impossible to not mention Andy Cohen and his own journey with surrogacy. Cohen’s daughter, Lucy, was one of the very first babies born in NYC under the new surrogacy laws. Cohen was frustrated by the laws prohibiting gestational surrogacy in his home state, so took matters into his own hands to advocate for surrogacy’s legalization. “I wanted my surrogate to have the baby in New York”, Cohen states, as his motivation to push this law through and get surrogacy legal in New York. ConceiveAbilities is proud to be among the first surrogacy agencies to be licensed in New York.

    "content": "U.S. Surrogacy Laws By State By Fran Caruso, Esq. ConceiveAbilities is your trusted resource for all things surrogacy including guidance through the legal process. Surrogacy laws vary from state to state and even sometimes county to county. That is why, in addition to our own internal team of expert attorneys, ConceiveAbilities partners with local, state specific attorneys who specialize in reproductive law. Surrogacy laws are ever-changing, but we are here to ensure you feel informed, comfortable, and assured as you proceed forward with the legal process. Below is a brief overview of the current laws impacting surrogacy in relevant states. We are always here to provide additional information and answer your questions so that you can feel confident from the legal perspective as you embark on a surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities. Illinois Illinois is ConceiveAbilities’ home base! In Illinois, gestational surrogacy is permitted via statute and allows intended parents(s) to be declared the legal parent(s) upon birth of the child as long as one intended parent is a genetic contributor to the child. As such, legal parentage is determined upon birth and intended parents can obtain a birth certificate from vital statistics directly. If the statute’s requirements are not met, or if a court order is needed for other reasons, then parentage may be determined via a post-birth order. Finally, if both egg donor and sperm donor are used, parental rights would be obtained via an adoption proceeding.Get more information about surrogacy in Illinois. New York As of February 15, 2021, compensated gestational surrogacy was made legal in New York via its new statute: the Child Parent Security Act (CPSA). The CPSA includes the Surrogate’s Bill of Rights–the first of its kind in the industry–as well as many requirements for the gestational carrier agreements. You can learn more about the CPSA and its impact on the surrogacy industry here.Notably, ConceiveAbilities was one of the first surrogacy agencies to be licensed by the New York Department of Health. To comply with the CPSA, ConceiveAbilities ensures that its intended parents and gestational carriers have experienced, well-versed reproductive attorneys who are knowledgeable of the CPSA. Under the CPSA, New York courts will grant pre-birth orders for all intended parents regardless of genetic contributors, marital status, or sexual orientation who are parties to a compensated surrogacy arrangement; and the order will go into effect at the time of the birth.Get more information about surrogacy in New York. Colorado Gestational surrogacy is legal in Colorado via the Colorado Surrogacy Agreement Act. The law protects both the intended parents and the gestational carrier who have entered into gestational carrier agreements consistent with the law. ConceiveAbilities ensures that during the drafting of the gestational carrier agreement all parties are represented by attorneys licensed in Colorado as is required by the law. Intended parents can proceed with a gestational carrier in Colorado regardless of their marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or need for surrogacy. Parentage can be determined via a pre-birth order from the juvenile court and said order will vest the intended parents with all parental rights and duties to the child immediately upon birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Colorado. California California is often thought of as the “friendliest” state for surrogacy and for good reason—California was the first state to enact a statute that makes surrogacy available to all! And while there are other states that are similarly as supportive and legally secure, California remains one of the most sought after states for surrogacy. Intended Parents, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy, can obtain a pre-birth order. This is true so long as any portion of the surrogacy occurred in California–specifically: (1) the county where the child is anticipated to be born, (2) the county where the intended parent(s) reside, (3) the county where the gestational carrier resides, (4) the county where the assisted reproduction agreement for gestational carrier is executed, or (5) the county where medical procedures pursuant to the GCA (i.e. embryo transfers) are to be performed. The pre-birth order becomes effective at the moment of birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Southern California and Northern California Oregon Although there are no specific surrogacy laws in Oregon, there are laws that contemplate the relationship between the intended parent(s) and a child conceived via assisted reproductive technology. Furthermore, there are no specific statutes or case law that prohibit surrogacy. Surrogacy is safely practiced in Oregon and is available to any and all types of intended parents who will legally be declared the parents of the child. Most judges issue pre-birth orders if there is a genetic connection between the intended parent(s) and child and in some cases even when there is not a genetic connection. Post-birth orders are also available if needed.Get more information about surrogacy in Oregon. Washington Rounding out the surrogacy friendly states of the west coast is Washington. As of January 1, 2019, Washington enacted a parentage statute that provides for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders. Pre-birth orders are granted regardless of the intended parent(s) marital status, sexual preference, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy. Pre-birth orders go into effect upon the birth of the child. Washington law defines who can be a “gestational surrogate” and provides specific details as to what terms need to be included in the gestational carrier for it to be enforceable. Specifically, a gestational carrier may not have completed more than two (2) surrogacies.Therefore, for all parties’ protection, it is critical that intended parents and gestational carriers work with experienced surrogacy professionals, like those at ConceiveAbilities, who are well versed in the specific requirements in Washington.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington. Minnesota Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Minnesota as no statute or published case law prohibits surrogacy. Surrogacy is available to Intended Parents regardless of marital status or genetic connection. Although many courts in several counties will grant pre-birth declaratory judgments, the more likely course of action is that parentage will be determined post-birth, especially if donor material was used. The relevant paperwork can be filed pre-birth, but it will not be granted until after birth. Additionally, a hearing is oftentimes required by the presiding judge meaning that all parties should anticipate remaining in Minnesota until the necessary legal work is completed. Arguably the most notable aspect of surrogacy in Minnesota is that if a judge will not sign a pre-birth declaratory judgment, a non-genetic parent will need to obtain a second parent adoption post-birth to confer parental rights. While the optics of this is not ideal, as it is the intended parents’ child, it is a critical step to ensure that all intended parents have equal legal rights to their child. The second parent adoption is typically completed quickly after birth in conjunction with the other post-birth legal proceedings in order to ensure both parents are named on the birth certificate.Get more information about surrogacy in Minnesota. Massachusetts Gestational surrogacy is supported in Massachusetts by three notable cases decided by the Commonwealth’s superior Court – Hodas v. Morin (2004); Culliton v. Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr. (2002); and R.R. v. M.H. (1998). Married and unmarried couples and single individuals, regardless of sexual orientation and/or genetic connection, may obtain a pre-birth order. A hearing is typically not required but is ultimately up to the judge’s discretion.Get more information about surrogacy in Massachusetts. Nevada Not to be outdone by its neighboring state of California, Nevada also has a surrogacy statute that permits gestational surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need. Pre-birth and post-birth orders are available. The Nevada statute specifically provides that parties may enter into gestational carrier agreements which contemplate payment of consideration for surrogacy services. The statute also requires that the gestational carrier agreement expressly state that the gestational carrier and her legal spouse/partner relinquish all rights and duties to the child conceived through assisted reproduction and that it is the intended parent(s) who are the parents of any resulting child. While the gestational carrier agreement would already state this regardless of the prevailing state law, Nevada has appropriately made this a statutory requirement for any gestational carrier agreement. Way to go Nevada!Get more information about surrogacy in Nevada. Pennsylvania Although there is no surrogacy statute in Pennsylvania, gestational surrogacy is still permitted and practiced. Pennsylvania declared in a 2006 case that a surrogacy contract is not contrary to public policy and that the gestational carrier is not the “legal mother.” Furthermore, in 2015, the Superior Court confirmed the enforceability of gestational carrier agreements as well as intended parents legal parentage to the child regardless of any genetic connection. Pre-birth orders are available, although this sometimes varies based on the specific county and judge, particularly if donor material is used. However, thanks to these court decisions, parties can safely proceed with gestational surrogacy in Pennsylvania.Get more information about surrogacy in Pennsylvania. Maryland Maryland has been a favorable state for gestational surrogacy since 2003. Similar to other states, parties are able to safely practice gestational surrogacy thanks to a favorable court decision (as compared to an explicit statute). Maryland’s highest court implicitly approved gestational surrogacy by determining that a gestational carrier is not required to be listed as the “mother” on the birth certificate of the child thereby leading to having the intended parents exclusively listed. Regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection, Intended Parents are able to establish their parental rights pre-birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Maryland. Georgia Despite no statutory or case law directly addressing surrogacy contracts in Georgia, it is a favorable state for gestational surrogacy. Courts regularly establish parental rights for Intended Parents through a pre-birth declaratory judgment regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic connection (although there may be additional paperwork required). The court process is typically very seamless – everything is usually handled directly between attorneys and usually no in-person hearing is required, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Georgia. Virginia Many are surprised to learn that surrogacy is authorized by statute in Virginia. Virginia’s “Status of Children of Assisted Conception” is unique because although it contemplates court approval process, this can only be done prior to embryo transfer and is not a pre-birth parentage order. It is instead a lengthy court process more akin to an adoption proceeding–home studies for all parties, the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the unborn child, and a full trial-like court hearing. Therefore, almost all Intended Parents bypass this and opt to establish their parental rights post-birth either through the administrative process contemplated in the statute or an order of parentage from the court. One other unique note for Virginia, the gestational carrier cannot sign any of the documents until 72 hours after the child is born. Finally, Virginia has a marital requirement for couples pursuing gestational surrogacy, but there need not be any genetic connection so long as ownership of the embryo can be proven. Ohio As of 2007, the Ohio Supreme Court has confirmed that gestational surrogacy is not against public policy and therefore gestational surrogacy is readily practiced in Ohio. While pre-birth orders are granted, they are discretionary meaning they are somewhat variable depending on the county. However, most counties will issue a pre-birth order for married Intended Parents, unmarried heterosexual couples, or singles regardless of sexual orientation or genetics. If not possible, Intended Parents can obtain a post-birth order to secure their parental rights.Get more information about surrogacy in Ohio. North Carolina Gestational surrogacy is practiced in North Carolina as there is no prohibition of it by either case law or statute. While most intended parents are able to obtain a pre-birth parentage, in some rare occasions parentage may be determined post-birth. The biggest factor is the intended parents’ marital status and genetic connection to the child. One specificity as to North Carolina gestational surrogacy is that when a known donor is used, the donor will also to be a party to the parentage legal proceedings. Nevertheless, single genetic parents, married and unmarried heterosexual couples with at least one genetic parent, and married same-sex couples with one genetic parent traditionally have no issue obtaining pre-birth orders as a matter of course.Get more information about surrogacy in North Carolina. Alabama Alabama courts regularly recognize gestational surrogacy and establish parental rights for married couples and single Intended Parents regardless of genetic connection. More often than not, Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth declaratory judgment; in cases where that is not allowed (based on the county), Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth consent which becomes effective five days after delivery of the child. Ultimately, a post birth order may be necessary.Get more information about surrogacy in Alabama. Florida In Florida, gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Ch.742.15 FL Stat.) but only for married couples. However, surrogacy is still available to unmarried and single Intended Parents in Florida via court orders so long as one Intended Parent has a genetic connection. Although technically providing pre-birth orders, Florida is unique in that the pre-birth orders act more as interim orders for medical decisions and paternity. A post birth order must be obtained before a birth certificate containing the Intended Parents’ names will be issued. Florida also has a strict medical need requirement with the statute providing specific medical requirements such as the Intended Mother is not able to physically gestate a pregnancy to term.Get more information about surrogacy in Florida. New Jersey In 2018, the Gestational Carrier Agreement Act went into effect in New Jersey. The Act provided for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders for all types of Intended Parents in accordance with specific conditions. For example, the gestational carrier agreement must be in writing, all parties must have completed mental health evaluations, and independent legal representation must have been provided for the gestational carrier and Intended Parents. These requirements and protections make New Jersey a very surrogacy friendly state.Get more information about surrogacy in New Jersey. Texas By statute, Texas permits gestational surrogacy for married intended parents (Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 160.752, § 160.753, § 160.754). Under the law, the “gestational agreement” (aka GCA) must be validated by the court to be enforceable and confer parental rights. If the parties have a validated gestational carrier agreement, married Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth order. For Intended Parents who are not married, or those who are single, judges have the discretion to grant pre-birth orders. The Texas statute also contemplates the option of a post-birth order. Regardless of pre-birth or post-birth, there must be a genetic connection between the IPs and the child. For unmarried IPs, the non-genetic parent would need to complete a second parent adoption. One unique aspect of the Texas law is that the gestational carrier agreement needs to be validated to be enforceable.Get more information about surrogacy in Texas. Wisconsin Wisconsin’s Supreme Court ruled in the 2013 case of Paternity of F.T.R., Rosecky v. Schissel that surrogacy contracts are enforceable so long as they are not contrary to the best interests of the child. Typically, intended parents, regardless of marital status, can obtain parentage orders placing their names on the birth certificate so long as one parent is genetically related to the child. If neither intended parent is genetically related to the child, a parentage order may be granted but this will depend on the particular county and judge. Additionally, while parentage orders are often issued pre-birth, they are considered “interim” orders and require a subsequent, final order issued after the child’s birth to facilitate obtaining the birth certificate. Finally, in many cases a hearing is required where all parties may be expected to appear.Get more information about surrogacy in Wisconsin. Connecticut The Connecticut Parentage Act (CPA) provides a protected path to parentage for any intended parents pursuing gestational surrogacy. The CPA ensures that all Connecticut children – regardless of the circumstances of their birth or the marital status, gender, or sexual orientation of their parents – have equal access to the security of a legal parent-child relationship. Furthermore, Connecticut has a statute that requires Vital Records to comply with court orders in issuing a birth certificate naming the intended parents in a gestational surrogacy arrangement as the parents. Parentage orders are granted pre-birth, but an in-person healing with all parties (intended parents, gestational carrier, and gestational carrier spouse) tends to be required.Get more information about surrogacy in Connecticut. Indiana At first blush, Indiana may not seem like an ideal state for surrogacy as there is a statute that voids gestational carrier agreements. However, Indiana attorneys advise that said statute only applies to traditional surrogacy (where the surrogate is genetically related to the child), not gestational surrogacy. For added protection, gestational carrier agreements, where the gestational carrier resides in Indiana will likely be drafted using the state law where the Intended Parents or fertility clinic are located. Nonetheless, gestational surrogacy is widely practiced in Indiana and courts regularly grant parental rights via pre and post birth parentage orders to married Intended Parents who have some genetic connection to the child. Single intended parents may also obtain a pre-birth order if genetically related to the child, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Indiana. Washington, D.C.Our nation’s capital has an express surrogacy statute. DC statutes (DC Law §§ 16-401 – 16-412) provide that all Intended Parents can obtain pre-birth orders establishing their parentage regardless of genetic connection, marital status, sexual orientation or need for surrogacy. Said orders do not become effective until the moment of birth and either the intended parents or gestational carrier need to have resided in DC for at least one (1) year. If neither party meets the residency requirement, a post-birth order can be obtained.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington, DC. Alaska With no case law or statute prohibiting surrogacy, gestational surrogacy is permitted and practiced in Alaska. It is generally anticipated that courts will establish parentage pre-birth for intended parents regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic link to the expected child, but due to limited surrogacy matters in the area, it is best pursued by heterosexual parents who are married using embryos with their own genetics. A hearing is most likely required and all parties may be ordered to appear with most cases being filed and heard in Anchorage. Arizona Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Arizona pursuant to a 1994 appellate court decision (Soos v. Superior Court) and courts acknowledge certain parental rights via court order. Some courts will allow pre-birth orders, but many courts wait until after the birth of the child before entering a maternity order. An intended father who is the biological contributor can be listed on the birth certificate without any order through the use of a paternity affidavit in conjunction with a denial of paternity affidavit by the gestational carrier’s husband if the gestational carrier is married.Notably, surrogacy contracts are unenforceable and prohibited by statute (Arizona Revised Statute § 25-218). So how do the parties lay out the terms of their agreement? Most commonly, in lieu of Arizona law, the prevailing law of the gestational carrier agreement will be that of another state that has a connection to the surrogacy arrangement, not Arizona; this state is most commonly California. If there is a California connection to the surrogacy (e.g. one Party lives in CA or the Fertility Center is located in CA), the Parties can also bypass court proceedings in Arizona and instead obtain a court order from California. These court orders are routinely accepted by Arizona hospitals and Vital Records.Ultimately, there are several nuances with the Arizona process which is why it is critical to work with an experienced assisted reproduction technology attorney that is knowledgeable of the Arizona process. Arkansas Surrogacy is statutorily permitted in Arkansas (Code § 9-10-201) and there is flexibility in the establishment of parental rights with married intended parents able to obtain pre-birth orders. However, unmarried intended parents who create embryos with donor material will require a second parent adoption in their home state as only the biological parent can obtain a pre-birth order. Furthermore, pursuant to the statute, vital records shall initially list the gestational carrier on the birth certificate documents and then permanently amend such records to name the intended parents as the true legal parents; even when a pre-birth order has been issued. Delaware Delaware may be small but it sure is mighty when it comes to surrogacy. Gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Delaware Code 13, § 8-801 – § 8-810) for any and all IPs regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, and genetic relationship to the child. Parentage is established pre-birth and the statute explicitly provides that the gestational carrier is “not a parent of a child born as a result of a gestational carrier arrangement” so long as specified requirements are met in the arrangement. Hawaii There is no existing statute or case law in Hawaii that prohibits surrogacy so it is freely practiced so long as there is a genetic connection between the intended parents and the child. If the embryo was created with the assistance of an egg or sperm donor, the non-biological parent must complete a second parent adoption either in Hawaii or their home state, in order for the child’s birth certificate to show them both as the parents. For the non-biological parent, parentage can only be established post-birth. However, a hearing for the parentage order typically requires at least the gestational carrier and her spouse, if applicable, to attend in person. Idaho As of July 1, 2023, Idaho Gestational Agreements Act went into effect making Idaho a favorable state for surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection. Under the new law, the parties can file a petition to have their gestational carrier agreement validated pre-birth which in turn makes it enforceable under the statute. Upon finding that the gestational carrier agreement is valid, the court shall issue an order validating the agreement and declaring that the intended parents are/will be the parent(s) of any child born under the terms of the agreement. Then post-birth, the court will issue a validation order and an order of parentage confirming that the intended parents are the parent(s) of the child. Iowa Surrogacy is implicitly permitted in Iowa from a culmination of three legal premises: (1) Iowa Code provides that surrogacy agreements are exempt from Iowa’s law prohibiting the purchase or sale of an individual, (2) Iowa’s administrative code addresses the issuance of birth certificates for children born to a gestational carrier (Iowa Admin. Code r. 641-99.15(144)), and (3) the Iowa Supreme Court held in 2018 that gestational carrier agreements are enforceable and do not violate public policy or the constitutional rights of the gestational carrier or child (P.M. & C.M. v. T.B. & D.B). Furthermore, in the same case, the court stated that gestational carrier agreements “promote families by enabling infertile couples to raise their own children and help bring new life into this world through willing surrogate mothers.”As a result of this, parentage in Iowa is established in two (2) parts. First, parentage is only to be established before birth for the biological father, resulting in a birth certificate listing the biological father with gestational carrier. Then post-birth a second order is necessary to permanently change the child’s birth certificate to list the second parent. This second order is either a parentage order for the other genetic parent or an adoption for a non-genetic parent. Have you thought about becoming a surrogate?

Based on the wants and needs of each party, identifying the right match for the right set of personalities and needs is essential for success.

Screening Our screenings aren’t just a box to tick off, they’re a key stage in our process. We work very hard to ensure surrogates can pass the respective fertility clinic’s criteria; in fact, 95% of our surrogates receive fertility clinic clearance. For surrogates and intended parents alike, the rigor of our screening process helps ensure that your investment of time and emotion is honored and secured. Equally important, matching at ConceiveAbilities is based on understanding the fundamental motivations and context behind the surrogacy arrangement. Who are the people involved? What is their background and their life experiences? What is life at home like? What is their vision for the surrogacy experience? These questions are vital to getting to know each surrogate and each intended parent, so that matches will be compatible. Local Matching Matters™ We know that geographic proximity between intended parents, surrogates and fertility clinics throughout your surrogacy journey might be important to you – for convenience, relationship building and peace of mind. We honor that desire, and because of our reach and popularity in communities across the country, we can address that need. You may find, in your matching process, that factors other than geographic proximity become more important to you. We see great success in both local and long distance surrogacy journeys.

    "content": "By Fran Caruso, Esq. When you embark on a surrogacy journey, you’ll learn all kinds of new medical and legal terminology. Something that you will hear referenced often, from the attorney’s office to the hospital, is the legal parentage process and accompanying legal documents. This process is the critical step whereby parentage is determined – though at what point and in what manner this occurs can vary by state. Depending on where your child is born, the legal parentage process will be completed either pre- or post-birth. What does pre-birth mean? The pre-birth process means that the relevant state law provides an avenue for the parties to present an order to a judge for entry prior to the child being born that establishes the intended parent(s) as the legal parents of the child. It will also likely direct the hospital to release the child to the intended parents after discharge and order the state’s Office of Vital Records to name the intended parents on the child’s birth certificate.What does post-birth mean?The post-birth process is overall procedurally the same as the pre-birth, but it occurs after the child is born. Often this is because the relevant state law contemplates the existence of a live child before anything can be filed or entered. But the ultimate result is the same – a birth certificate with the intended parents’ names and secure legal parentage of the child in favor of the intended parents. What are the legal risks? A common concern amongst intended parents when discussing pre-versus post-birth is whether there is a greater legal risk associated with the post-birth process; i.e., can the gestational carrier decide to keep the baby? In a word, no. ConceiveAbilities will only match intended parents and gestational carriers in a state that supports their respective rights. As the pregnant person, the gestational carrier will have standing to object to the process, whether in a pre- OR a post-birth state. But in either case and what really matters, is that such an objection would be a losing argument. The gestational carrier will have no genetic relationship to the child, there will be a gestational carrier agreement outlining the parties’ rights and responsibilities, and affidavits from doctors and lawyers proving that the intended parents are entitled to legal parentage. Additionally, there will be other documents in place, such as a HIPAA release and power of attorney, ensuring that the intended parents may make all medical decisions for the child and that the child is discharged into their care.On the flip side, a common concern amongst gestational carriers is what happens if the intended parents do not take the baby; do I become responsible? Again, the answer is no. The gestational carrier agreement protects the gestational carrier from any legal or medical responsibility for the child. We encourage you to not focus on whether the legal parentage will occur pre- versus post-birth because, in either circumstance, the intended parents’ legal rights will be secured, and their names will end up on the child’s birth certificate; it is truly a question of when it procedurally occurs. A Final Note on Legal Parentage Every state, whether pre-birth, post-birth, or some amalgamation of the two, has its own unique process and requirements. That is why it is critical to work with an experienced Assisted Reproductive Technology lawyer and agency; you do not want to be some one’s first when it comes to securing parental rights.

    "content": "By Fran Caruso, Esq. A surrogacy contract (also known as a Gestational Carrier Agreement or GCA) is arguably one of the most important documents of the surrogacy journey. Below is a brief overview of the process of drafting the GCA as well as the different terms, rights, and responsibilities that will be contemplated by all parties in the GCA. Drafting the Surrogacy Contract The intended parents and the gestational carrier should each have their own separate independent attorney’s who specialize in reproductive law. Having a separate attorney represent each party ensures a fair and equal representation of both the parties interests. The GCA is drafted by the intended parents’ attorney and includes all of the substantive terms discussed during the matching process. The intended parents will review the agreement with their attorney and then it will be sent to the gestational carrier and her attorney for review. Through their respective attorney’s, the parties will then negotiate the terms of the GCA until all parties have agreed. All parties should expect that there will be some back and forth negotiation of the GCA; this is a good thing and ensures that both parties had adequate representation and understand their rights and responsibilities. Once the terms are agreed to, all parties will execute the GCA and move onto the phase of the journey. Understanding the Contract Topics The GCA exists to protect all parties and ensure everyone understands their rights and responsibilities. Below are some of the terms that will be contemplated in the GCA. Recitals & General Provisions: These sections outline the relevant information about all parties as well as the intent of everyone entering into this agreement. This is essentially a background section that provides critical information as to who, what, where, when, and why. You will also find a numerous defined terms located in this section that provide clarification for the remainder of the GCA. Travel: Provides the details around when and where the gestational carrier can travel during the journey. There will be certain restrictions on travel, both domestic and international, to ensure that the child is born in a surrogacy friendly state. Confidentiality: This section will detail what information may or may not be disclosed regarding the intended parents, gestational carrier, terms of the GCA, and resulting pregnancy. This will also contemplate any future contact between the parties and disclosure to the child that they were born via surrogacy. Medical Considerations: These sections contain some of the most lengthy and sensitive terms including medical screening, testing, undergoing procedures, taking medications, embryo transfer, gestational carrier’s limitations while pregnant, vaccinations, termination or selective reduction, medical emergencies, and facts surrounding delivery of the child. Finances: This will not only detail any financial compensation/reimbursements the gestational carrier is entitled to, but will also detail financial responsibilities for things like insurance, lost wages, bedrest, etc. For a more in-depth breakdown of the cost of surrogacy, read more here. Parentage: The GCA will cite the specific state’s legal authority. It will also detail the process for obtaining the necessary parentage documents to declare the intended parents as the legal parents of the child. It will also contemplate the specific details as to custody and care of the child immediately following birth. Breach & Termination of Agreement: While all parties enter into the GCA hoping and anticipating that there will be no problems, it is essential that the worst-case scenarios are acknowledged and anticipated. Assumption of Risk: Surrogacy and pregnancy are complex matters. All parties need to understand not only their protections, but also the potential risks. “Boiler Plate” Terms: The final part of the GCA will include numerous terms, which are called “boiler plate” terms as they can be found in most contracts, not just surrogacy contracts. These will include things like identification of the respective attorneys, notice requirements, modification procedures, signature specifics, etc. Even though the GCA may not necessarily be the most exciting aspect of the surrogacy, it is extremely important and is critical to confirming all parties are on the same page at the outset of the journey. Take your time in reviewing the GCA and be sure to ask your attorney any and all questions. Learn more about growing your family with surrogacy.

Surrogacy Legal Concepts: Frequently Asked Questions It is important to know the legal landscape for surrogacy so you feel confident and can be a full participant in the process. Here are the answers to some of your common questions:: What is a Gestational Carrier Agreement (“GCA”)? The legal contract between the surrogate and her intended parents, known as the Gestational Carrier Agreement (“GCA”), sits at the heart of your match with intended parents. It’s equally crucial for both surrogate and intended parent alike, so that each parties’ rights and responsibilities to one another are clearly outlined. What is the Legal Gold Standard for Surrogate Rights? Every state has different surrogacy laws and legal precedents. New York recently enacted the Gestational Surrogates’ Bill of Rights, the gold standard of surrogate rights. It ensures gestational surrogates are aware of their rights as they relate to their health and welfare, right to independent legal counsel, health insurance and medical costs, life insurance and contract termination protections. Can intended parents choose not to take the baby? No. The gestational carrier agreement protects the surrogate from any kind of legal or medical responsibility for the child. That said, the concern that the surrogate may become attached to the baby is a common misconception about surrogacy. Listen to our Busting Surrogacy Myths with Dr. Heather Carlson to learn more about surrogacy facts. How is Legal Parentage Established during Surrogacy? A court order ensures that the parentage is properly established. The particulars of how and when the court order occurs vary by state; at ConceiveAbilities, our legal experts guide these activities. A pre-birth order is a court order that establishes the intended parent(s) as the legal parents of the baby. What is the Legal Difference in Types of Surrogacy? First, it’s important to address the different types of surrogacy. While it’s rarely practiced today – and in many states, it’s illegal – traditional (genetic) surrogacy still exists. This means that the surrogate’s own egg is used, making her the child’s genetic mother. It can invite many potential legal and other complications, which is why few intended parents choose this route and is not a type of surrogacy offered by ConceiveAbilities. In the more common gestational surrogacy arrangement, and the arrangement that ConceiveAbilities work with exclusively, the surrogate undergoes In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and carries a child that is genetically related to the intended parents or donor(s). With a proper legal contract in place to protect all parties, gestational surrogacy arrangements are the safest route. Surrogacy laws by state Surrogacy laws vary by state. First and foremost, the surrogate must reside in a state where surrogacy is permitted. In states where surrogacy is specifically prohibited, there may be a risk of criminal and civil penalties, among other risks. Working with a reputable agency like ConceiveAbilities and an attorney who is well versed in surrogacy law is the only way to mitigate these risks; having surrogacy contracts explained protects both the intended parents’ and the surrogate’s rights. Ultimately, recognizing a surrogate’s rights are imperative to a smooth surrogacy journey. We’re here to inform and support you every step of the way.

Paris credits her friend Kim Kardashian to helping her understand surrogacy. ConceiveAbilities Director of Legal Services, Gina-Marie Madow, told DailyMail.com about the influence celebrity has on surrogacy in Everything You Need to Know About Celebrity Surrogacy. She shared that celebrities using surrogacy and sharing their stories had helped normalize it and inspire more women to get involved in the process. “We recently hired [research firm] Accelerant Research to better understand surrogacy. Our research shows almost half of the people surveyed were first exposed to surrogacy through a TV show, or a celebrity surrogacy story like Paris Hilton’s. It also shows that women who have read about or watched celebrity surrogacy journeys are inspired to learn more about becoming a surrogate. Celebrities sharing their surrogacy journeys also normalize the surrogacy process, normalizing the fertility treatment for hopeful parents to grow their families via a surrogate.” On Tuesday, Hilton shared a statement with People about their child, which read: “It’s always been my dream to be a mother and I’m so happy that Carter and I found each other. We are so excited to start our family together and our hearts are exploding with love for our baby boy.” Congratulations, Paris and Carter on your dream come true!
