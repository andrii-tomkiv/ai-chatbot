Can you recall a time when a nurse understood your needs even when you didn’t? We can. And, did you know that the pain of an infertility diagnosis is on par with the pain of being diagnosed with cancer, heart disease and other serious maladies? And that nurses are typically the first and most important resource attending to the emotional needs of these patients? We do. And we’re determined to help nurses in new ways. Read about our #EmpowerNursesChallenge. Do you know a nurse in your life that gives her heart to her patients? Empower nurses to take time for themselves! Nurses are the backbone of the healthcare system, playing a crucial role in patient care, advocacy, and emotional support. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, nursing is the nation’s largest healthcare profession, with nearly 4.7 million registered nurses (RNs) nationwide. Of all licensed registered nurses, 89% are employed in nursing. Nurses are the primary providers of hospital patient care and deliver most of the nation’s long-term medical care. Moreover, nurses are the single most trusted professional among a wide array, with 78% of us saying that they have high or very high levels of honesty and ethical standards. Nurses have held this distinction for over 20 years. The importance of nurses extends beyond clinical skills. Nurses give comfort and compassion to patients and families during some of the most vulnerable moments of their lives. This unwavering dedication often comes at a cost. Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. What is Compassion Fatigue According to The National Institutes of Health, compassion fatigue is defined as stress resulting from exposure to a traumatized individual. Professionals regularly exposed to the traumatic experiences of the people they service, such as healthcare, emergency and community service workers, are particularly susceptible to developing Compassion Fatigue. This can adversely impact the everyday lives of these individuals, as well as patient care and relationships with colleagues. It can lead to more serious mental health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. At ConceiveAbilities, in our efforts to support family-building through surrogacy and egg donation, we see and are particularly awed by the many fertility clinic nurses working with these families. At the same time, we know that the ongoing exposure to the lasting trauma of infertility creates substantial and real risks of compassion fatigue for these heroic nurses. Infertility is, indeed, a serious and traumatic condition. Nurses at our fertility clinic partners, as well as many of our surrogates who are also nurses, have experienced compassion fatigue but, at ConceiveAbilities, we believe that it does not have to be this way. Through our #EmpowerNursesChallenge, we are showing our appreciation to nurses by raising awareness about this problem and efforts to be resilient to it. As one gesture in a complex puzzle, we are thrilled to announce that we are donating 100 $100 gift cards to the nurses you know and love who join our challenge!

Resources to Combat Compassion Fatigue and Build Compassion Resilience Nurses are particularly vulnerable to compassion fatigue due to their everyday exposure to individuals that are experiencing trauma, including those that are suffering from infertility. Nurses also have the best insights about how to be resilient in the face of compassion fatigue. Through these videos, we want to assist nurses in sharing their best resiliency tips and strategies with one another. Here are some thought starters, based on five strategies to help nurses combat compassion fatigue: Implement Regular Self-Care Physical Health: Prioritize exercise, nutritious meals, and adequate sleep. Simple practices like staying hydrated and taking short breaks during shifts can make a big difference. Check out The Gym Nurse for workout split ideas and more health tips! Mental and Emotional Health: Engage in mindfulness, meditation, or breathing exercises. Take time for activities that bring joy and relaxation outside of work.

Here is Forbes list of Best Online Therapy Service of 2024. Foster Your relationships: Make time for lunch with a friend, date night with your significant other, and for your hobbies. Find your person who can be your sounding board to help you debrief from a hard day. Set and Maintain Boundaries Work-Life Separation: Develop clear boundaries between work and personal life to avoid carrying work-related stress home. Time Management: Learn to prioritize tasks and delegate when possible. Taking regular, scheduled breaks during shifts can also help manage stress. The American Nurses Association offers these Time Management Tips for Nurses. Foster Peer Support and Connection Support Groups: Join or form support groups with fellow nurses to share experiences and offer mutual support. Team Communication: Regular debriefings and open communication within the team can provide a sense of solidarity and shared understanding. Engage in Professional Development Continual Learning: Attend workshops, training sessions, and conferences focused on managing compassion fatigue and enhancing self-care techniques. Reflective Practice: Engage in reflective practices, such as journaling or discussing challenging cases with peers, to gain perspective and learn from experiences. Integrating these strategies can help nurses manage compassion fatigue more effectively, ensuring they maintain their well-being while providing high-quality care. What are your best tips?

    "content": "Share our #MilkDonationChallenge on social media and tag friends who are breastfeeding or pumping to donate breastmilk for money ConceiveAbilities, a surrogacy and egg donation agency dedicated to empowering women to find their giving journey, is once again launching a campaign to encourage lactating women to donate breastmilk for money and save infant lives. In two years, over 1 million individuals have helped to identify lactating women and make a lifesaving impact on infants in need of nourishment by promoting breast milk donation. The relaunch of the #MilkDonationChallenge recognizes the profound influence that a single act of generosity can have on those facing challenges. It aims to support lactating women who want to make a difference not only through their paid breast milk donations to help infants in need, but also inspiring other lactating women to join the giving journey. ConceiveAbilities’ Founder Nazca Fontes initiated the #MilkDonationChallenge to assist milk banks in replenishing their supply during the infant formula shortage. Since then, it continues as a significant movement. “Our vision to create a positive impact for families in need of nourishment has gained widespread attention, spreading rapidly across communities,” offers Fontes. “We are steadfastly dedicated to providing support for strong family foundations and for women who long to be part of these giving, growing and empowering communities.” The challenge runs until September 30, 2025. Do You Know a Lactating Woman? Here’s How to Join or Refer Them to Our the Paid Breast Milk Donation Challenge Everyone can play a role in the 2025 #MilkDonationChallenge and help us spread the word. Create a link and text, email and share that link on your social channels with potentially lactating women. Each person in your community who enters their information will learn more about how they can participate in the 2025 #MilkDonationChallenge. Second, donate breast milk to help families. Your breast milk donation can make a profound impact and every donor receives a $250 gift card for her time and effort.

Proof of donation must include: first and last name, phone number, date of donation, number of ounces donated, and the milk bank you donated to. It can be in the form of an email verification or donor portal photo. Not necessary, but an added bonus! Share a photo to help inspire other lactating moms to join the challenge (by sharing you agree ConceiveAbilities may use in our marketing including digital and social channels) Milk Donor Champion Stories Our Milk Donor Champions have made an incredible impact, contributing over 15% of the national milk bank supply.

Inspired by the giving nature of their surrogates, ConceiveAbilities Surrogacy and Egg Donor Agency launched the #MilkDonationChallenge in 2022, a movement to replenish milk bank supplies across the nation to help these families in need. The impacts of this shortage still persist. “In our work to help build families for more than twenty-five years, we know that many women find purpose in helping other families at a time of great need,” shared Founder Nazca Fontes, adding, “Like surrogacy, milk banks play a vital role in supporting families. We stand ready to assist all women who are able to help lift up other women, mothers, and families and help provide much needed nutrition to their babies. While there is – yet still – so much work to be done to address the infant formula shortage, we hope an increase of breast milk donations will be a lifeline for these families at this critical time.” Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services, adds, “Our surrogates are incredibly giving and often donate their breast milk after their surrogacy journey. By inspiring more women to donate, we hope those who are facing this uncertainty can rest easy at night knowing they can provide critical nutrition for their babies.” More Resources for Lactating Women: Do you need help finding lactation consultant services?

    "content": "Surrogacy, particularly social surrogacy, is often misunderstood. Many mistakenly believe Intended Mothers choose surrogacy for superficial reasons, like convenience or vanity, but these assumptions are far from reality. Social surrogacy decisions are often rooted in complex personal, professional, or health-related factors. Intended Parents may turn to surrogacy to safeguard their health, manage career demands, or ensure their family’s well-being. Judging these decisions without understanding their full context overlooks the deeply personal and sometimes difficult choices involved. Watch this video for a full explanation about Medical Surrogacy vs Social Surrogacy** What is the Difference Between Medical and Social Surrogacy? Surrogacy is commonly categorized into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While legal parentage considerations often drive this distinction, many Intended Parents mistakenly believe they can only pursue surrogacy for a “medical need.” But, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we strongly support all Intended Parents in their journey to grow their families, and appreciate a wide array of reasons for doing so — whether those reasons are medical in nature, or not. Surrogacy is typically classified into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While some assume surrogacy is only available for medical reasons, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we believe every Intended Parent deserves support in their efforts to build a family. Medical Need A clear medical need for surrogacy typically involves conditions that prevent Intended Parents from carrying a pregnancy to term. This includes scenarios such as: Diagnosed infertility Male same-sex couples Women without a uterus Individuals with life-threatening illnesses Additionally, specific fertility diagnoses, histories of cancer, necessary medication that is incompatible with pregnancy, and more may also qualify as medical needs. In addition, we have seen some mental health diagnoses rising to the medical need threshold. The “strength” of an Intended Parent’s medical need may impact which states they can match with a surrogate, as surrogacy laws vary across jurisdictions. The bottom line for a medical need is that a doctor (be it a reproductive endocrinologist or other appropriate specialist) has made a medical opinion and determination that the Intended Parents have a medical need to pursue surrogacy. The legal community typically will look for such a decision to be made in writing. Social Surrogacy On the other hand, anything that is not a “clear medical need” falls under the social surrogacy category. Unfortunately, this option often carries a stigma, with critics assuming the Intended Mother simply wants to avoid the physical aspects of pregnancy for reasons of vanity, convenience, or wanting to shift the risks to someone else. In practice, however, that is rarely true. The vast majority of individuals seeking parenthood through the path of surrogacy for reasons other than a “clear medical need” have a reasonable and valid need for surrogacy based on meaningful life circumstances. Here are some common examples of reasonable necessity: Professional Athletes: Athletes like professional ballerinas may have limited career windows where peak physical performance is critical. Her physical appearance and athleticism are critical components of her livelihood and opportunity for success. If she were to take time off to have a child, she risks her career. Surrogacy allows professional athletes a viable and crucial path to growing their family. Unexplained Infertility: In cases where a doctor cannot determine why a couple or person is unable to conceive and is uncomfortable making a medical determination that they cannot carry a pregnancy, some opt for surrogacy to ensure the best chance of having a child. High Risk Careers: Individuals in high-risk professions, such as pilots or construction workers, often face demanding physical challenges and potential hazards on the job. Choosing surrogacy allows them to protect their health and well-being, while also safeguarding their baby’s development. For a pilot, long hours, high altitudes, and fluctuating cabin pressure could pose serious risks during pregnancy. Similarly, construction workers may encounter dangerous environments that could jeopardize both the mother and baby. Surrogacy offers these professionals peace of mind, enabling them to continue their livelihoods without compromising the safety of their family. Familial Health Concerns: Intended Mothers with a strong family history of serious health conditions, like breast cancer, may choose surrogacy to avoid potential risks tied to pregnancy hormones. Challenging Recovery: Some Intended Mothers have a medical condition that does not inherently preclude her from carrying, but would make recovery from delivery an especially arduous, lengthy process. Surrogacy allows them to focus on their health and be present for their newborn child. Our Commitment to Building Families At ConceiveAbilities, we recognize that every family’s surrogacy journey is unique. Our focus is on understanding the why behind each decision– whatever that may be – ensuring that both the Intended Parents and surrogates feel fully informed and comfortable. Through our Matching Matters™ process, we work closely with surrogates to ensure they’re aware of the Intended Parents’ reasons for choosing surrogacy, whether it’s medical, not medical, or a combination of factors. “The key is transparency,” says Fran Caruso, Esq. “We help surrogates and Intended Parents build relationships based on trust and mutual understanding.” Ultimately, we are proud to support Intended Parents from all walks of life. We have deep regard and appreciation for the fact that there are a wide array of important reasons for why people pursue surrogacy. Begin your surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities today. We are honored to assist you in growing your family.",

    "content": "Managing surrogacy-related medical expenses can be complex, time-consuming, and overwhelming, and insurance companies often complicate the process. As your full service surrogacy agency, it is our job to guide and protect you through every step of the surrogacy process.

Common Surrogacy Medical Coverage Questions What is the cost of my surrogate’s medical coverage? The direct medical coverage for your surrogate is fully included in our All-In Program.

Any surrogacy pregnancy related costs that her insurance does not cover will be handled through our All-In Program’s direct medical coverage, which eliminates common exclusions found in standard policies. Can my health insurance cover surrogacy-related costs? No, your insurance will not cover medical expenses for the gestational carrier since she is not a member of your policy. However, once the baby is born, your insurance may apply to the baby’s medical care.

    "content": "Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. ConceiveAbilities spoke with Clinical Nurse Liaison, Kristina Fabis, APRN, FNP-BC, RNC-OB. Kristina was a labor and delivery nurse with over 23 years of experience before joining the ConceiveAbilities team. Kristina has been a surrogate three times with ConceiveAbilities, “Being a nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a surrogate has brought fulfillment and purpose to my life. It has allowed me to care for others in their time of need.” Read below to learn more about compassion fatigue and how Kristina recommends nurses take care of themselves. How have you experienced compassion fatigue in your nursing career?I’ve experienced compassion fatigue a few different ways and times throughout my nursing career. The majority of my career was spent in a busy Labor and Delivery unit that was frequently understaffed. Not only did I work full time but I was often required to work ‘on-call.’ I was at the hospital so much, both during the day and back overnight. It slowly led to exhaustion. While I would never let it affect how I treated or cared for my patients, my identity was slowly slipping away. I was beginning to forget who I was outside of the hospital; as a mom, wife, friend, daughter, you name it. I began to feel like I was ‘going through the motions.’ I was a robot who could only do one thing: care for others and never for herself. Over the years, we observed a notable increase in the severity of our patients’ conditions which often affected their post delivery recovery, even leading to emergency situations. That resulted in extremely stressful work environments. I began to experience burnout. What are ways you decompress, relax, and recharge when experiencing compassion fatigue?I really utilize my vacation time. I rely on my friends and family. I encourage others to speak up about their struggles and their experiences. Put the chore or household task aside and spend 15, 30, or 60 minutes doing something you love which brings you joy. I plan activities outside of the hospital and home to help me decompress. This includes spending time at the lake, training for a 5k, or even a quick girls weekend. What communities have helped you navigate the highs and lows of your nursing career?Undoubtedly, my work family was the #1 community that helped me to navigate the highs and lows of my nursing career. My co-workers and colleagues became my second family, especially considering how much time we spent around each other each week. More than anyone, they knew how I felt and the challenges we faced as nurses. When a hospital’s administration or our department manager left us understaffed and with limited resources, it was my fellow nurses that I leaned on and vice versa. Together we got through countless emergent and stressful situations. What advice do you have for other nurses struggling with compassion fatigue? Put Yourself First: Make yourself a priority. Develop new interests outside of medicine and your profession. Take Care of Your Health: Your health, including what you put into your body, how frequently you exercise and how long you rest, is important. Take a walk, even if only for 10 minutes; those additional steps do have an impact. Commit to a healthier diet. No change is too small. Have Something to Anticipate: Always have something that you are looking forward to. Leverage Available Support Networks: Look into your employer’s EAP (Employee Assistance Program) plan. Mental health is important. There are even numerous virtual platforms, such as BetterHelp, these days which make therapy and counseling possible from the confines of your own home. Ensure You Get Enough Sleep: Finally, don’t deprive yourself of sleep or underestimate its importance. How do you combat compassion fatigue as a nurse?

    "content": "Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. ConceiveAbilities met with Kelly Rayburn, a registered nurse with over 27 years experience, to talk about her work with compassion fatigue. While receiving her Masters in Nursing, Kelly dedicated her research towards compassion fatigue. Below are her insights and answers to some commonly asked questions surrounding compassion fatigue. Tell us about your academic work with compassion fatigue.My research project when I was getting my Masters in Nursing was on Compassion Fatigue. Two group members and I were all experienced Labor & Delivery nurses and had only heard the topic in relation to other nursing specialities. We decided to see if L&D nurses were also at risk for compassion fatigue. After an extensive literature review, we were not finding much information on compassion fatigue in our area of nursing. We created our own research study. The end result? Yes, L&D nurses are at risk for compassion fatigue. When people hear that I used to work as a nurse in L&D, they say, “Oh that must be so fun!” or “It must be so cool to hold babies all day.” Yes, it was fun. No, we do not hold babies all day. When things were good, it left one with a sense of pride and accomplishment. When terrible events occurred, however, which they unfortunately did, it left a traumatic mark on all involved. Our study identified L&D nurses were at risk for compassion fatigue and then focused on ways to combat it. Nurses are always supporting and caring for others, but who supports the nurse caring for others? How have you experienced compassion fatigue in your nursing career?For me, there wasn’t one clear event that led to compassion fatigue. An unresolved traumatic event, running a support group for bereaved mothers when you are grieving yourself, days of being in charge and making decisions for the unit, and being short staffed and working beyond your capabilities with no break all led to compassion fatigue. My first insights into compassion fatigue surfaced when I realized that when I got home from work, I had nothing left to give my family. I felt empty, unable to make the simplest of decisions, unable to enjoy their company, so exhausted that I just wanted to sleep, and lying in bed not able to sleep as the days replayed themselves. My personality was changing. I would sit in my car every morning wondering if I really did need to go inside the building, pray that “nothing bad would happen today on my watch,” and feel just an overwhelming sense of anxiety entering the hospital. When my job became more about charting defensively “in case” something happened, and less about providing the nurturing competent care that I should have been focused on, I knew it was time to leave the bedside. I no longer felt the joy that each delivery brought; I no longer felt I cared enough, did enough, or was enough. What are ways you decompress, relax, and recharge when experiencing compassion fatigue?My family is the most important thing in the world to me. When I left the bedside, I wanted to make sure it was to do something that would allow me more time with them. I decompress by spending time with my grandkids, playing with them, laughing with them, and snuggling them. I’ve learned all too well that you don’t get that time back. They recharge my sense of balance in this world. When I was in the deepest hole of compassion fatigue and depression, I sought solace and advice from friends. True friends that are there for the thick of it, including my bedside nursing friends who understood the fears and anxiety and my teaching friends who offered support when the pandemic hit and we all scrambled to find a new way of educating future nursing students. For me, talking relieved some of the burnout. When I was too tired to talk, I used other avenues of comfort, including listening to Christian music, reading, riding my bike, hiking in the woods, and crafting. Twice a year I go with friends to a weekend scrapbook retreat. There I can create memory books, reminisce about pictures, share stories, and just laugh with no other agenda. It is my “me time.” What communities have helped you navigate the highs and lows of your nursing career?Absolutely my faith. I pray to a higher being and trust that He is always looking out for me; my faith has been instrumental in my ability to survive compassion fatigue. While I do not get to service often, I listen to uplifting Christian music that “speaks” my story; these songs inspire me to be a better person and to have faith even when things seem impossible. My friends have also helped me navigate the highs and lows of my career. Their support, encouragement, advice, and time together helped me maneuver so much these past 30 years. My hobbies are an escape from my career; a time for me to be something other than a nurse, an educator and a manager. Immersion in my hobbies is one time I can just be me. What resources, products, and suggestions can you provide for other nurses struggling with compassion fatigue?When we started our research project, we were looking specifically at Labor and Delivery, Postpartum, and NICU nurses. We understand now, especially in light of the pandemic, that no specific specialty is immune to compassion fatigue. It isn’t even exclusive to nursing. Anyone who provides care for someone else who has pain, suffering, and mental anguish can experience compassion fatigue. My suggestions are: Find someone that you can trust and confide in. Seek a friend or a counselor who has experience with compassion fatigue. Journal your feelings and experiences. Explore what it is that you need to do in order to get healthy. We can’t care for others when we cannot care for ourselves. Is it time away, time off, time with people, time alone? Think about what makes you happy and do more of it! Even if it’s scheduling a few minutes a day to start and working up from there. I wouldn’t be a nurse if I didn’t throw this in here: proper sleep, exercise and nutrition. Again, start slow. A walk around the house, the block, the neighborhood. Reconnect with nature. Have a hobby that you have always wanted to try? Do it! A hobby sitting unfinished? Start it back up again. Finally, accept that it is ok to NOT be ok. As nurses we are accustomed to giving care, not accepting it. We advocate for our patients, but not often enough for ourselves. Understand that compassion fatigue and everything that comes with it is normal. The ability to recognize it and treat it allows us to survive it.

    "content": "Support Guide for the Military Wife Only those who experience it firsthand truly understand the unique demands of military wife life. And these challenges are faced not only by the service members on assignment but the family members who support them. Building your family with flexibility and care is key as you consider life in the service. At ConceiveAbilities, we support a number of military families as they pursue surrogacy, which is why we have put together this dedicated support guide tailored to help families navigate military life. Understanding Military Life with Family There are a handful of challenges you may face as a military wife, and even more if you have kids to parent. Fortunately, there are many other wives and moms who understand and have been through, or are currently going through, similar obstacles. Some of these challenges include: Parenting alone during spouse’s deployment Relocating to a new base across the country Finding community and support where you live Knowing how to utilize healthcare services for pregnancy, childbirth, maternity, and pediatric care Choosing a suitable career that is flexible with the military lifestyle Below, we’ll address common questions related to these challenges and offer some tips from other military wives and moms who have learned through their experiences how to adapt and thrive in the midst of the demands of military wife life. Common Military Questions & Answers About Being a Military Wife Deployment and Parenting How do I parent alone during my spouse’s military deployment? Parenting solo isn’t easy, but by following some helpful, tried-and-true tips from other military wives, you can do it! A Mother Far From Home recommends: Embracing community for yourself and your kids Hiring a babysitter so you can run errands, spend time with friends, and relax Asking family to come for a visit to offer a helping hand Celebrating the little things, like making it to the next month as a kind of countdown until your spouse returns Establishing a routine for your kids. Their lives may change a lot, but their day-to-day routines can remain somewhat consistent Communicating with your spouse whenever possible; and when you aren’t on a call, talk about them with your kids Prioritizing your mental health by keeping your mind in the present and seeking help when you need it What are some ways I can help my child cope with a parent’s deployment? First, know there are military and family life counseling programs available to you and your children. Don’t be afraid to utilize these resources and support during this time. A few other things that could help include: Letting them voice what they’re feeling to you; listen with an open mind so they know they’re heard Allowing them to get involved in clubs, sports, or other community activities as a healthy distraction throughout the week Keeping a consistent routine to their day Maintaining long-distance contact with parent whenever possible Planning activities like making homecoming signs, special countdowns, or crafting memory scrapbooks How can we maintain a strong family bond when my spouse is deployed? Maintaining a strong long-distance relationship as a couple and a family can be difficult, but the biggest help is openly communicating one another’s expectations and making a plan ahead of time. Some expectations to discuss include: How do you plan to keep in touch (phone, texts, social media, Facetime, zoom, email, letters)? What methods of communication would be most helpful for each person to feel emotionally connected to the other (care packages, singing songs together, sending videos or pictures, starting a journal to record and share special memories and moments)? Consider asking other military spouses you know what worked best for their family for more ideas.Relocations and Transitions How can I help my child adjust to new schools and make friends quickly after military relocation? One of the best ways to help your child adjust to their new school is by getting involved. The first person you can contact is the school liaison officer who focuses on helping students with school transitions. Next, consider joining the PTA or getting involved in the school Facebook group to look for ways you can volunteer at the school. This is a great way to get to know other parents and help your kids get connected with new friends. What resources are available to help us understand each new location better for an easier transition? Similar to most new moves, one of the best things you can do to get to know a new city is to get out and explore. Try out coffee shops and local restaurants to find places you might want to frequent while you’re there. You can also get on social media and get connected with local groups to discover events happening near you or find common interest groups you might want to join. If your kids start joining sports clubs or teams, that’s another great way to fill your time and get to know local residents who can give you recommendations for things to do and see. How do I maintain my own career with frequent moves due to my spouse’s military transitions? If you’re already established in a job you enjoy, consider asking your boss if you can stay on and work remotely. While that may seem like a big ask, and your ability to do so will depend on the job, you don’t have much to lose. Not to mention, with the rise in remote work, it’s entirely possible they will be willing to work with you. At the very least, it shows your level of care for the organization or company and desire to stay on with them, which could open up future opportunities to come back and work for them when your spouse’s assignment is done or if you happen to relocate back to the area. When remote work is not an option, consider searching for a future job in your profession that has your needed flexibility. Community and Support Where can I connect with other military spouses who understand what I’m going through? Aside from getting to know other families your spouse works with, locally stationed at the same base, there are groups you can join, from military spouse groups listed on MeetUp and Facebook to programs like the Military Spouse Advocacy Network. Any of these groups would be helpful to connect with so you can combat common feelings of loneliness as a military spouse. How do I stay connected with friends and family who are far away? There are many tools at our disposal today to help us stay connected with friends and family when you live far away. Some of these include tools like Facetime, Zoom, texting, mailing letters and care packages, WhatsApp, Marco Polo, SnapChat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and GroupMe. Just be mindful of safe social posting practices when your spouse is active in the military for your safety and theirs. Where can I find information about local community events and activities for military families to get involved in quickly? One of the best ways to find this information is through local Facebook groups, newspaper or news station event announcements, or searching on Google for a list of activities near you. Accessing Healthcare Services How does our family access healthcare services after relocating? There are a few options for families when looking for a provider that accepts a TRICARE plan. The first is visiting the military treatment facility (MTF) on base. This will be the easiest method of seeking care, but it’s not the only one. The other option is to search for a military hospital or clinic, network provider, or non-network provider using the TRICARE website. What are TRICARE’s coverage options for maternity care and pediatric visits? TRICARE has an extensive list of medical services that are covered in relation to conception and delivery, including prenatal care, post-partum care (generally 6 weeks after delivery), and treatment of any complications. Discover a more comprehensive list of services on the TRICARE website as well as your plan options. For pediatric visits, TRICARE says it covers office visits, immunizations, and vision screenings from birth to age 6 at no cost, regardless of plan selection. Learn more about their pediatric healthcare services on their website. What mental health services are available through TRICARE? Is this available for spouses and children? There are a number of mental health therapeutic services available for military personnel, as well as their spouse and children. For a full list of services, visit the TRICARE website here. Flexible Career Options What are the best career fields for military spouses? The best career opportunities for military spouses are going to be jobs that allow for remote and flexible work. This is ideal when needing to relocate and for managing more at home during your spouse’s deployment. How can I continue my education or professional training online? If you’re in school finishing your degree, or taking classes to further your career, speak with the professor or school about continuing your education online or transferring your current course credits to an online educational institution. Are there specific employment programs to help military wives find jobs? There are services available like Hire Heroes USA that helps you prepare for and find a flexible job as a military spouse, or even for veterans when your spouse finishes their duty. Stories of Resilience and Success Growing up as a military brat and eight years as a military spouse, ConceiveAbilities surrogate and employee, Tayler Lewis has a deep passion for both the military community and surrogacy. In a heartfelt conversation on our podcast, “All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes,” Tayler shares, “As a military spouse, we tend to resonate with words like “calling” and “purpose.” We may not serve in the same capacity as our active duty partners, but we strive to make a difference. That can look like volunteering, engaging in our community, and supporting others as they navigate the challenges of military life. We are also on a mission. We truly believe that we are fulfilling an important purpose. Military spouses are known for their resourcefulness, for creating strategies, and for executing plans. Surrogacy provides us with a similar sense of calling.” Listen to Tayler’s full podcast A Calling to Serve: An Interview with Military Spouse Tayler Lewis on Becoming a Surrogate. Read more stories from military spouseswho found their calling through surrogacy. How Surrogacy Fits into the Military Family Lifestyle Surrogacy is a process in which a woman carries a child who is not genetically related to her for someone else. The motive behind surrogacy—helping someone in the community who can’t have a child of their own—aligns well with the military family lifestyle in desiring to serve others. It offers significant financial compensation while providing the flexibility military families need to be present with their own family and do something that can be accomplished in the midst of frequent relocations.“I wanted to become a surrogate for as long as I can remember. After having two easy pregnancies, I felt it was time to share my super amazing ability as a woman to help a deserving family. At the time, my husband was stationed in Illinois on Recruiting Duty for the Marine Corps, so I took the opportunity to pursue my dream; he was supportive from the very beginning! Knowing that I could help create or grow a family was the most amazing feeling in the world.After a successful delivery of a baby girl, my heart was full and I knew my life had changed forever. I decided that surrogacy was something I was extremely passionate about, so I decided to pursue it in my career as well. Now, I work here at ConceiveAbilities as a Surrogate Engagement Coordinator, helping potential surrogates get started on their own surrogacy journeys. I can’t imagine a job more fulfilling and I am still able to help grow families every day.” Ashley Wilson, Experienced Surrogate, Mom of 2, Marine Wife Learn More About Surrogacy as a Military Wife",

    "content": "How to Ship Frozen Breast Milk Can you ship breast milk? Yes! Whether you are a new mother who is breastfeeding or you are a lactating surrogate who is preparing to ship breast milk to intended parents, you may be wondering how to ship breast milk. Working moms traveling for business may also find it beneficial to ship their milk home. No matter your reasons for wanting to ship breast milk, our team can help. We put together a comprehensive guide on how to mail breast milk effectively and safely, including some important do’s and don’ts on mailing breast milk, ensuring your milk arrives in the best condition while you focus on how to maintain and increase milk supply. Steps to Shipping Breast Milk First, select an insulated shipping container. You can search on platforms like Amazon for a container that is leakproof and structurally sound for transport. Collect your breast milk. First, label durable, BPA-free bags, bottles, or pouches with the date. Then, use a breast pump to fill them with milk, remove the excess air, and seal them. Be prepared to freeze them as soon as you finish this step.Pro Tip: As you’re filling your bags/bottles/pouches, leave some room in them; the milk will expand when frozen. Otherwise, they will burst. Once the milk is frozen, pack the breast milk in your insulated box as tightly as possible. The milk should go into the box first, then the other items to cool and insulate it. Shipping a smaller amount of milk? You can nestle it between layers of ice packs.Pro Tip: If the milk doesn’t fill the box, you’ll want to strategically load up the rest of the box. Add in packing material such as newspaper and then put the frozen gel packs or ice packs on top, cover it with a plastic bag, and then seal it in the box. Want even more peace of mind? Include a temperature monitoring device within your shipment, which can ensure the milk maintains a safe temperature. Finish packaging the shipment by taping it up with duct tape and labeling it. Label requirements may differ across courier services, so inquire about additional information if needed. There are additional methods for packing up your breast milk. For instance, you can use thick-walled Styrofoam coolers and cardboard boxes. Simply store your breast milk storage bags in the cooler and place them in the cardboard box or shipping box. Make sure to choose a cooler that is not too large but is large enough for the ice packs, insulation material, and breast milk. Watch our How To Pump, Ship and Donate Breast Milk Surrogacy Tutorial with Lactation Expert Lenna Gregory Do’s and Don’ts of Shipping Breast Milk Do: Use an insulated box. It needs to be sturdy, as well as able to withstand freezing and thawing. Pack tightly. You want to preserve the milk and prevent it from moving too much in transit. Label the package properly. As you’re writing your labels, indicate that the shipment includes frozen breast milk that is perishable. Breast milk is considered “liquid gold“ and must be treated as such! Ship overnight, as you want the breast milk to stay frozen in transit. DHL, FedEx, UPS, and USPS offer milk shipping services, so you can rest assured your shipment will maintain its temperature and be delivered quickly. You can also check out specialized organizations like Milk Stork that take care of shipping for you. Consider timing when shipping your breast milk. You will want to avoid shipping later in the week; weekend deliveries generally cost more, and on Sundays, there is no delivery service. Earlier in the week, such as on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, you are less likely to face delays. Update the recipient on shipping details. By providing the recipient with relevant tracking information, you can prepare them to accept your shipment and store the milk right away. Don’t: Freeze breast milk without removing air first. This can result in freezer burn. Use dry ice. It doesn’t melt, but rather, goes through sublimation. In other words, the dry ice changes from a solid to a gas. Because of this, pressure could build up in your package, and it could even explode in transit. Ship 2-day. Do not use 2-day services or ground service to ship milk. It will thaw. Because breast milk is perishable, it must be transported swiftly in a temperature-controlled environment. Make sure milk is being shipped by an overnight service that is guaranteed. Pack loosely. The contents of your package need to be snug. Bubble wrap, crumbled newspaper, and foam peanuts can be used for padding. If you need an alternative, you can purchase shipping kits from companies like Save the Milk. Pack and ship breast milk without researching local laws in your location and the recipient’s location. This is extremely important if you plan to ship breast milk internationally. Though it’s legal (and relatively straightforward) to ship breast milk within the United States, you may have to abide by additional requirements based on that specific country’s regulations.On a similar note, if you’re donating breast milk to a milk bank or hospital (especially the NICU), you will likely need to follow specific instructions from them as well. Handling Breast Milk Upon Delivery As long as milk is over 50% frozen when it arrives, it can be put into the freezer and be safe to feed to babies. Families receiving the milk should open the package and inspect the milk to make sure everything is frozen and in good condition. Then, they should freeze it immediately and use it within 6 months (if stored in the refrigerator freezer) or 12 months (if stored in the deep freezer). Of course, breast milk shipping experiences between women will be different. For example, service providers’ pricing—and how they determine shipping costs based on distance to the destination, package weight, and other factors—will vary. But, with careful planning, shipping frozen breast milk can be a smooth and rewarding experience, leaving you to concentrate on maintaining and increasing your milk supply. Looking for more guidance?
