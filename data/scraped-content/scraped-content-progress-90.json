Can you recall a time when a nurse understood your needs even when you didn’t? We can. And, did you know that the pain of an infertility diagnosis is on par with the pain of being diagnosed with cancer, heart disease and other serious maladies? And that nurses are typically the first and most important resource attending to the emotional needs of these patients? We do. And we’re determined to help nurses in new ways. Read about our #EmpowerNursesChallenge. Do you know a nurse in your life that gives her heart to her patients? Empower nurses to take time for themselves! Nurses are the backbone of the healthcare system, playing a crucial role in patient care, advocacy, and emotional support. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, nursing is the nation’s largest healthcare profession, with nearly 4.7 million registered nurses (RNs) nationwide. Of all licensed registered nurses, 89% are employed in nursing. Nurses are the primary providers of hospital patient care and deliver most of the nation’s long-term medical care. Moreover, nurses are the single most trusted professional among a wide array, with 78% of us saying that they have high or very high levels of honesty and ethical standards. Nurses have held this distinction for over 20 years. The importance of nurses extends beyond clinical skills. Nurses give comfort and compassion to patients and families during some of the most vulnerable moments of their lives. This unwavering dedication often comes at a cost. Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. What is Compassion Fatigue According to The National Institutes of Health, compassion fatigue is defined as stress resulting from exposure to a traumatized individual. Professionals regularly exposed to the traumatic experiences of the people they service, such as healthcare, emergency and community service workers, are particularly susceptible to developing Compassion Fatigue. This can adversely impact the everyday lives of these individuals, as well as patient care and relationships with colleagues. It can lead to more serious mental health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. At ConceiveAbilities, in our efforts to support family-building through surrogacy and egg donation, we see and are particularly awed by the many fertility clinic nurses working with these families. At the same time, we know that the ongoing exposure to the lasting trauma of infertility creates substantial and real risks of compassion fatigue for these heroic nurses. Infertility is, indeed, a serious and traumatic condition. Nurses at our fertility clinic partners, as well as many of our surrogates who are also nurses, have experienced compassion fatigue but, at ConceiveAbilities, we believe that it does not have to be this way. Through our #EmpowerNursesChallenge, we are showing our appreciation to nurses by raising awareness about this problem and efforts to be resilient to it. As one gesture in a complex puzzle, we are thrilled to announce that we are donating 100 $100 gift cards to the nurses you know and love who join our challenge!

Resources to Combat Compassion Fatigue and Build Compassion Resilience Nurses are particularly vulnerable to compassion fatigue due to their everyday exposure to individuals that are experiencing trauma, including those that are suffering from infertility. Nurses also have the best insights about how to be resilient in the face of compassion fatigue. Through these videos, we want to assist nurses in sharing their best resiliency tips and strategies with one another. Here are some thought starters, based on five strategies to help nurses combat compassion fatigue: Implement Regular Self-Care Physical Health: Prioritize exercise, nutritious meals, and adequate sleep. Simple practices like staying hydrated and taking short breaks during shifts can make a big difference. Check out The Gym Nurse for workout split ideas and more health tips! Mental and Emotional Health: Engage in mindfulness, meditation, or breathing exercises. Take time for activities that bring joy and relaxation outside of work.

Here is Forbes list of Best Online Therapy Service of 2024. Foster Your relationships: Make time for lunch with a friend, date night with your significant other, and for your hobbies. Find your person who can be your sounding board to help you debrief from a hard day. Set and Maintain Boundaries Work-Life Separation: Develop clear boundaries between work and personal life to avoid carrying work-related stress home. Time Management: Learn to prioritize tasks and delegate when possible. Taking regular, scheduled breaks during shifts can also help manage stress. The American Nurses Association offers these Time Management Tips for Nurses. Foster Peer Support and Connection Support Groups: Join or form support groups with fellow nurses to share experiences and offer mutual support. Team Communication: Regular debriefings and open communication within the team can provide a sense of solidarity and shared understanding. Engage in Professional Development Continual Learning: Attend workshops, training sessions, and conferences focused on managing compassion fatigue and enhancing self-care techniques. Reflective Practice: Engage in reflective practices, such as journaling or discussing challenging cases with peers, to gain perspective and learn from experiences. Integrating these strategies can help nurses manage compassion fatigue more effectively, ensuring they maintain their well-being while providing high-quality care. What are your best tips?

    "content": "Share our #MilkDonationChallenge on social media and tag friends who are breastfeeding or pumping to donate breastmilk for money ConceiveAbilities, a surrogacy and egg donation agency dedicated to empowering women to find their giving journey, is once again launching a campaign to encourage lactating women to donate breastmilk for money and save infant lives. In two years, over 1 million individuals have helped to identify lactating women and make a lifesaving impact on infants in need of nourishment by promoting breast milk donation. The relaunch of the #MilkDonationChallenge recognizes the profound influence that a single act of generosity can have on those facing challenges. It aims to support lactating women who want to make a difference not only through their paid breast milk donations to help infants in need, but also inspiring other lactating women to join the giving journey. ConceiveAbilities’ Founder Nazca Fontes initiated the #MilkDonationChallenge to assist milk banks in replenishing their supply during the infant formula shortage. Since then, it continues as a significant movement. “Our vision to create a positive impact for families in need of nourishment has gained widespread attention, spreading rapidly across communities,” offers Fontes. “We are steadfastly dedicated to providing support for strong family foundations and for women who long to be part of these giving, growing and empowering communities.” The challenge runs until September 30, 2025. Do You Know a Lactating Woman? Here’s How to Join or Refer Them to Our the Paid Breast Milk Donation Challenge Everyone can play a role in the 2025 #MilkDonationChallenge and help us spread the word. Create a link and text, email and share that link on your social channels with potentially lactating women. Each person in your community who enters their information will learn more about how they can participate in the 2025 #MilkDonationChallenge. Second, donate breast milk to help families. Your breast milk donation can make a profound impact and every donor receives a $250 gift card for her time and effort.

Proof of donation must include: first and last name, phone number, date of donation, number of ounces donated, and the milk bank you donated to. It can be in the form of an email verification or donor portal photo. Not necessary, but an added bonus! Share a photo to help inspire other lactating moms to join the challenge (by sharing you agree ConceiveAbilities may use in our marketing including digital and social channels) Milk Donor Champion Stories Our Milk Donor Champions have made an incredible impact, contributing over 15% of the national milk bank supply.

Inspired by the giving nature of their surrogates, ConceiveAbilities Surrogacy and Egg Donor Agency launched the #MilkDonationChallenge in 2022, a movement to replenish milk bank supplies across the nation to help these families in need. The impacts of this shortage still persist. “In our work to help build families for more than twenty-five years, we know that many women find purpose in helping other families at a time of great need,” shared Founder Nazca Fontes, adding, “Like surrogacy, milk banks play a vital role in supporting families. We stand ready to assist all women who are able to help lift up other women, mothers, and families and help provide much needed nutrition to their babies. While there is – yet still – so much work to be done to address the infant formula shortage, we hope an increase of breast milk donations will be a lifeline for these families at this critical time.” Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services, adds, “Our surrogates are incredibly giving and often donate their breast milk after their surrogacy journey. By inspiring more women to donate, we hope those who are facing this uncertainty can rest easy at night knowing they can provide critical nutrition for their babies.” More Resources for Lactating Women: Do you need help finding lactation consultant services?

    "content": "Surrogacy, particularly social surrogacy, is often misunderstood. Many mistakenly believe Intended Mothers choose surrogacy for superficial reasons, like convenience or vanity, but these assumptions are far from reality. Social surrogacy decisions are often rooted in complex personal, professional, or health-related factors. Intended Parents may turn to surrogacy to safeguard their health, manage career demands, or ensure their family’s well-being. Judging these decisions without understanding their full context overlooks the deeply personal and sometimes difficult choices involved. Watch this video for a full explanation about Medical Surrogacy vs Social Surrogacy** What is the Difference Between Medical and Social Surrogacy? Surrogacy is commonly categorized into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While legal parentage considerations often drive this distinction, many Intended Parents mistakenly believe they can only pursue surrogacy for a “medical need.” But, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we strongly support all Intended Parents in their journey to grow their families, and appreciate a wide array of reasons for doing so — whether those reasons are medical in nature, or not. Surrogacy is typically classified into two types: medical need and social surrogacy. While some assume surrogacy is only available for medical reasons, that’s not the case. At ConceiveAbilities, we believe every Intended Parent deserves support in their efforts to build a family. Medical Need A clear medical need for surrogacy typically involves conditions that prevent Intended Parents from carrying a pregnancy to term. This includes scenarios such as: Diagnosed infertility Male same-sex couples Women without a uterus Individuals with life-threatening illnesses Additionally, specific fertility diagnoses, histories of cancer, necessary medication that is incompatible with pregnancy, and more may also qualify as medical needs. In addition, we have seen some mental health diagnoses rising to the medical need threshold. The “strength” of an Intended Parent’s medical need may impact which states they can match with a surrogate, as surrogacy laws vary across jurisdictions. The bottom line for a medical need is that a doctor (be it a reproductive endocrinologist or other appropriate specialist) has made a medical opinion and determination that the Intended Parents have a medical need to pursue surrogacy. The legal community typically will look for such a decision to be made in writing. Social Surrogacy On the other hand, anything that is not a “clear medical need” falls under the social surrogacy category. Unfortunately, this option often carries a stigma, with critics assuming the Intended Mother simply wants to avoid the physical aspects of pregnancy for reasons of vanity, convenience, or wanting to shift the risks to someone else. In practice, however, that is rarely true. The vast majority of individuals seeking parenthood through the path of surrogacy for reasons other than a “clear medical need” have a reasonable and valid need for surrogacy based on meaningful life circumstances. Here are some common examples of reasonable necessity: Professional Athletes: Athletes like professional ballerinas may have limited career windows where peak physical performance is critical. Her physical appearance and athleticism are critical components of her livelihood and opportunity for success. If she were to take time off to have a child, she risks her career. Surrogacy allows professional athletes a viable and crucial path to growing their family. Unexplained Infertility: In cases where a doctor cannot determine why a couple or person is unable to conceive and is uncomfortable making a medical determination that they cannot carry a pregnancy, some opt for surrogacy to ensure the best chance of having a child. High Risk Careers: Individuals in high-risk professions, such as pilots or construction workers, often face demanding physical challenges and potential hazards on the job. Choosing surrogacy allows them to protect their health and well-being, while also safeguarding their baby’s development. For a pilot, long hours, high altitudes, and fluctuating cabin pressure could pose serious risks during pregnancy. Similarly, construction workers may encounter dangerous environments that could jeopardize both the mother and baby. Surrogacy offers these professionals peace of mind, enabling them to continue their livelihoods without compromising the safety of their family. Familial Health Concerns: Intended Mothers with a strong family history of serious health conditions, like breast cancer, may choose surrogacy to avoid potential risks tied to pregnancy hormones. Challenging Recovery: Some Intended Mothers have a medical condition that does not inherently preclude her from carrying, but would make recovery from delivery an especially arduous, lengthy process. Surrogacy allows them to focus on their health and be present for their newborn child. Our Commitment to Building Families At ConceiveAbilities, we recognize that every family’s surrogacy journey is unique. Our focus is on understanding the why behind each decision– whatever that may be – ensuring that both the Intended Parents and surrogates feel fully informed and comfortable. Through our Matching Matters™ process, we work closely with surrogates to ensure they’re aware of the Intended Parents’ reasons for choosing surrogacy, whether it’s medical, not medical, or a combination of factors. “The key is transparency,” says Fran Caruso, Esq. “We help surrogates and Intended Parents build relationships based on trust and mutual understanding.” Ultimately, we are proud to support Intended Parents from all walks of life. We have deep regard and appreciation for the fact that there are a wide array of important reasons for why people pursue surrogacy. Begin your surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities today. We are honored to assist you in growing your family.",

    "content": "Managing surrogacy-related medical expenses can be complex, time-consuming, and overwhelming, and insurance companies often complicate the process. As your full service surrogacy agency, it is our job to guide and protect you through every step of the surrogacy process.

Common Surrogacy Medical Coverage Questions What is the cost of my surrogate’s medical coverage? The direct medical coverage for your surrogate is fully included in our All-In Program.

Any surrogacy pregnancy related costs that her insurance does not cover will be handled through our All-In Program’s direct medical coverage, which eliminates common exclusions found in standard policies. Can my health insurance cover surrogacy-related costs? No, your insurance will not cover medical expenses for the gestational carrier since she is not a member of your policy. However, once the baby is born, your insurance may apply to the baby’s medical care.

    "content": "Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. ConceiveAbilities spoke with Clinical Nurse Liaison, Kristina Fabis, APRN, FNP-BC, RNC-OB. Kristina was a labor and delivery nurse with over 23 years of experience before joining the ConceiveAbilities team. Kristina has been a surrogate three times with ConceiveAbilities, “Being a nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a surrogate has brought fulfillment and purpose to my life. It has allowed me to care for others in their time of need.” Read below to learn more about compassion fatigue and how Kristina recommends nurses take care of themselves. How have you experienced compassion fatigue in your nursing career?I’ve experienced compassion fatigue a few different ways and times throughout my nursing career. The majority of my career was spent in a busy Labor and Delivery unit that was frequently understaffed. Not only did I work full time but I was often required to work ‘on-call.’ I was at the hospital so much, both during the day and back overnight. It slowly led to exhaustion. While I would never let it affect how I treated or cared for my patients, my identity was slowly slipping away. I was beginning to forget who I was outside of the hospital; as a mom, wife, friend, daughter, you name it. I began to feel like I was ‘going through the motions.’ I was a robot who could only do one thing: care for others and never for herself. Over the years, we observed a notable increase in the severity of our patients’ conditions which often affected their post delivery recovery, even leading to emergency situations. That resulted in extremely stressful work environments. I began to experience burnout. What are ways you decompress, relax, and recharge when experiencing compassion fatigue?I really utilize my vacation time. I rely on my friends and family. I encourage others to speak up about their struggles and their experiences. Put the chore or household task aside and spend 15, 30, or 60 minutes doing something you love which brings you joy. I plan activities outside of the hospital and home to help me decompress. This includes spending time at the lake, training for a 5k, or even a quick girls weekend. What communities have helped you navigate the highs and lows of your nursing career?Undoubtedly, my work family was the #1 community that helped me to navigate the highs and lows of my nursing career. My co-workers and colleagues became my second family, especially considering how much time we spent around each other each week. More than anyone, they knew how I felt and the challenges we faced as nurses. When a hospital’s administration or our department manager left us understaffed and with limited resources, it was my fellow nurses that I leaned on and vice versa. Together we got through countless emergent and stressful situations. What advice do you have for other nurses struggling with compassion fatigue? Put Yourself First: Make yourself a priority. Develop new interests outside of medicine and your profession. Take Care of Your Health: Your health, including what you put into your body, how frequently you exercise and how long you rest, is important. Take a walk, even if only for 10 minutes; those additional steps do have an impact. Commit to a healthier diet. No change is too small. Have Something to Anticipate: Always have something that you are looking forward to. Leverage Available Support Networks: Look into your employer’s EAP (Employee Assistance Program) plan. Mental health is important. There are even numerous virtual platforms, such as BetterHelp, these days which make therapy and counseling possible from the confines of your own home. Ensure You Get Enough Sleep: Finally, don’t deprive yourself of sleep or underestimate its importance. How do you combat compassion fatigue as a nurse?

    "content": "Compassion fatigue, the emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from continuous empathy and caring for others, is taking a significant toll on nurses. It not only affects nurse well-being but also impacts the care delivered by nurses, highlighting the need for resources to build compassion fatigue resilience. ConceiveAbilities met with Kelly Rayburn, a registered nurse with over 27 years experience, to talk about her work with compassion fatigue. While receiving her Masters in Nursing, Kelly dedicated her research towards compassion fatigue. Below are her insights and answers to some commonly asked questions surrounding compassion fatigue. Tell us about your academic work with compassion fatigue.My research project when I was getting my Masters in Nursing was on Compassion Fatigue. Two group members and I were all experienced Labor & Delivery nurses and had only heard the topic in relation to other nursing specialities. We decided to see if L&D nurses were also at risk for compassion fatigue. After an extensive literature review, we were not finding much information on compassion fatigue in our area of nursing. We created our own research study. The end result? Yes, L&D nurses are at risk for compassion fatigue. When people hear that I used to work as a nurse in L&D, they say, “Oh that must be so fun!” or “It must be so cool to hold babies all day.” Yes, it was fun. No, we do not hold babies all day. When things were good, it left one with a sense of pride and accomplishment. When terrible events occurred, however, which they unfortunately did, it left a traumatic mark on all involved. Our study identified L&D nurses were at risk for compassion fatigue and then focused on ways to combat it. Nurses are always supporting and caring for others, but who supports the nurse caring for others? How have you experienced compassion fatigue in your nursing career?For me, there wasn’t one clear event that led to compassion fatigue. An unresolved traumatic event, running a support group for bereaved mothers when you are grieving yourself, days of being in charge and making decisions for the unit, and being short staffed and working beyond your capabilities with no break all led to compassion fatigue. My first insights into compassion fatigue surfaced when I realized that when I got home from work, I had nothing left to give my family. I felt empty, unable to make the simplest of decisions, unable to enjoy their company, so exhausted that I just wanted to sleep, and lying in bed not able to sleep as the days replayed themselves. My personality was changing. I would sit in my car every morning wondering if I really did need to go inside the building, pray that “nothing bad would happen today on my watch,” and feel just an overwhelming sense of anxiety entering the hospital. When my job became more about charting defensively “in case” something happened, and less about providing the nurturing competent care that I should have been focused on, I knew it was time to leave the bedside. I no longer felt the joy that each delivery brought; I no longer felt I cared enough, did enough, or was enough. What are ways you decompress, relax, and recharge when experiencing compassion fatigue?My family is the most important thing in the world to me. When I left the bedside, I wanted to make sure it was to do something that would allow me more time with them. I decompress by spending time with my grandkids, playing with them, laughing with them, and snuggling them. I’ve learned all too well that you don’t get that time back. They recharge my sense of balance in this world. When I was in the deepest hole of compassion fatigue and depression, I sought solace and advice from friends. True friends that are there for the thick of it, including my bedside nursing friends who understood the fears and anxiety and my teaching friends who offered support when the pandemic hit and we all scrambled to find a new way of educating future nursing students. For me, talking relieved some of the burnout. When I was too tired to talk, I used other avenues of comfort, including listening to Christian music, reading, riding my bike, hiking in the woods, and crafting. Twice a year I go with friends to a weekend scrapbook retreat. There I can create memory books, reminisce about pictures, share stories, and just laugh with no other agenda. It is my “me time.” What communities have helped you navigate the highs and lows of your nursing career?Absolutely my faith. I pray to a higher being and trust that He is always looking out for me; my faith has been instrumental in my ability to survive compassion fatigue. While I do not get to service often, I listen to uplifting Christian music that “speaks” my story; these songs inspire me to be a better person and to have faith even when things seem impossible. My friends have also helped me navigate the highs and lows of my career. Their support, encouragement, advice, and time together helped me maneuver so much these past 30 years. My hobbies are an escape from my career; a time for me to be something other than a nurse, an educator and a manager. Immersion in my hobbies is one time I can just be me. What resources, products, and suggestions can you provide for other nurses struggling with compassion fatigue?When we started our research project, we were looking specifically at Labor and Delivery, Postpartum, and NICU nurses. We understand now, especially in light of the pandemic, that no specific specialty is immune to compassion fatigue. It isn’t even exclusive to nursing. Anyone who provides care for someone else who has pain, suffering, and mental anguish can experience compassion fatigue. My suggestions are: Find someone that you can trust and confide in. Seek a friend or a counselor who has experience with compassion fatigue. Journal your feelings and experiences. Explore what it is that you need to do in order to get healthy. We can’t care for others when we cannot care for ourselves. Is it time away, time off, time with people, time alone? Think about what makes you happy and do more of it! Even if it’s scheduling a few minutes a day to start and working up from there. I wouldn’t be a nurse if I didn’t throw this in here: proper sleep, exercise and nutrition. Again, start slow. A walk around the house, the block, the neighborhood. Reconnect with nature. Have a hobby that you have always wanted to try? Do it! A hobby sitting unfinished? Start it back up again. Finally, accept that it is ok to NOT be ok. As nurses we are accustomed to giving care, not accepting it. We advocate for our patients, but not often enough for ourselves. Understand that compassion fatigue and everything that comes with it is normal. The ability to recognize it and treat it allows us to survive it.

    "content": "Support Guide for the Military Wife Only those who experience it firsthand truly understand the unique demands of military wife life. And these challenges are faced not only by the service members on assignment but the family members who support them. Building your family with flexibility and care is key as you consider life in the service. At ConceiveAbilities, we support a number of military families as they pursue surrogacy, which is why we have put together this dedicated support guide tailored to help families navigate military life. Understanding Military Life with Family There are a handful of challenges you may face as a military wife, and even more if you have kids to parent. Fortunately, there are many other wives and moms who understand and have been through, or are currently going through, similar obstacles. Some of these challenges include: Parenting alone during spouse’s deployment Relocating to a new base across the country Finding community and support where you live Knowing how to utilize healthcare services for pregnancy, childbirth, maternity, and pediatric care Choosing a suitable career that is flexible with the military lifestyle Below, we’ll address common questions related to these challenges and offer some tips from other military wives and moms who have learned through their experiences how to adapt and thrive in the midst of the demands of military wife life. Common Military Questions & Answers About Being a Military Wife Deployment and Parenting How do I parent alone during my spouse’s military deployment? Parenting solo isn’t easy, but by following some helpful, tried-and-true tips from other military wives, you can do it! A Mother Far From Home recommends: Embracing community for yourself and your kids Hiring a babysitter so you can run errands, spend time with friends, and relax Asking family to come for a visit to offer a helping hand Celebrating the little things, like making it to the next month as a kind of countdown until your spouse returns Establishing a routine for your kids. Their lives may change a lot, but their day-to-day routines can remain somewhat consistent Communicating with your spouse whenever possible; and when you aren’t on a call, talk about them with your kids Prioritizing your mental health by keeping your mind in the present and seeking help when you need it What are some ways I can help my child cope with a parent’s deployment? First, know there are military and family life counseling programs available to you and your children. Don’t be afraid to utilize these resources and support during this time. A few other things that could help include: Letting them voice what they’re feeling to you; listen with an open mind so they know they’re heard Allowing them to get involved in clubs, sports, or other community activities as a healthy distraction throughout the week Keeping a consistent routine to their day Maintaining long-distance contact with parent whenever possible Planning activities like making homecoming signs, special countdowns, or crafting memory scrapbooks How can we maintain a strong family bond when my spouse is deployed? Maintaining a strong long-distance relationship as a couple and a family can be difficult, but the biggest help is openly communicating one another’s expectations and making a plan ahead of time. Some expectations to discuss include: How do you plan to keep in touch (phone, texts, social media, Facetime, zoom, email, letters)? What methods of communication would be most helpful for each person to feel emotionally connected to the other (care packages, singing songs together, sending videos or pictures, starting a journal to record and share special memories and moments)? Consider asking other military spouses you know what worked best for their family for more ideas.Relocations and Transitions How can I help my child adjust to new schools and make friends quickly after military relocation? One of the best ways to help your child adjust to their new school is by getting involved. The first person you can contact is the school liaison officer who focuses on helping students with school transitions. Next, consider joining the PTA or getting involved in the school Facebook group to look for ways you can volunteer at the school. This is a great way to get to know other parents and help your kids get connected with new friends. What resources are available to help us understand each new location better for an easier transition? Similar to most new moves, one of the best things you can do to get to know a new city is to get out and explore. Try out coffee shops and local restaurants to find places you might want to frequent while you’re there. You can also get on social media and get connected with local groups to discover events happening near you or find common interest groups you might want to join. If your kids start joining sports clubs or teams, that’s another great way to fill your time and get to know local residents who can give you recommendations for things to do and see. How do I maintain my own career with frequent moves due to my spouse’s military transitions? If you’re already established in a job you enjoy, consider asking your boss if you can stay on and work remotely. While that may seem like a big ask, and your ability to do so will depend on the job, you don’t have much to lose. Not to mention, with the rise in remote work, it’s entirely possible they will be willing to work with you. At the very least, it shows your level of care for the organization or company and desire to stay on with them, which could open up future opportunities to come back and work for them when your spouse’s assignment is done or if you happen to relocate back to the area. When remote work is not an option, consider searching for a future job in your profession that has your needed flexibility. Community and Support Where can I connect with other military spouses who understand what I’m going through? Aside from getting to know other families your spouse works with, locally stationed at the same base, there are groups you can join, from military spouse groups listed on MeetUp and Facebook to programs like the Military Spouse Advocacy Network. Any of these groups would be helpful to connect with so you can combat common feelings of loneliness as a military spouse. How do I stay connected with friends and family who are far away? There are many tools at our disposal today to help us stay connected with friends and family when you live far away. Some of these include tools like Facetime, Zoom, texting, mailing letters and care packages, WhatsApp, Marco Polo, SnapChat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and GroupMe. Just be mindful of safe social posting practices when your spouse is active in the military for your safety and theirs. Where can I find information about local community events and activities for military families to get involved in quickly? One of the best ways to find this information is through local Facebook groups, newspaper or news station event announcements, or searching on Google for a list of activities near you. Accessing Healthcare Services How does our family access healthcare services after relocating? There are a few options for families when looking for a provider that accepts a TRICARE plan. The first is visiting the military treatment facility (MTF) on base. This will be the easiest method of seeking care, but it’s not the only one. The other option is to search for a military hospital or clinic, network provider, or non-network provider using the TRICARE website. What are TRICARE’s coverage options for maternity care and pediatric visits? TRICARE has an extensive list of medical services that are covered in relation to conception and delivery, including prenatal care, post-partum care (generally 6 weeks after delivery), and treatment of any complications. Discover a more comprehensive list of services on the TRICARE website as well as your plan options. For pediatric visits, TRICARE says it covers office visits, immunizations, and vision screenings from birth to age 6 at no cost, regardless of plan selection. Learn more about their pediatric healthcare services on their website. What mental health services are available through TRICARE? Is this available for spouses and children? There are a number of mental health therapeutic services available for military personnel, as well as their spouse and children. For a full list of services, visit the TRICARE website here. Flexible Career Options What are the best career fields for military spouses? The best career opportunities for military spouses are going to be jobs that allow for remote and flexible work. This is ideal when needing to relocate and for managing more at home during your spouse’s deployment. How can I continue my education or professional training online? If you’re in school finishing your degree, or taking classes to further your career, speak with the professor or school about continuing your education online or transferring your current course credits to an online educational institution. Are there specific employment programs to help military wives find jobs? There are services available like Hire Heroes USA that helps you prepare for and find a flexible job as a military spouse, or even for veterans when your spouse finishes their duty. Stories of Resilience and Success Growing up as a military brat and eight years as a military spouse, ConceiveAbilities surrogate and employee, Tayler Lewis has a deep passion for both the military community and surrogacy. In a heartfelt conversation on our podcast, “All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes,” Tayler shares, “As a military spouse, we tend to resonate with words like “calling” and “purpose.” We may not serve in the same capacity as our active duty partners, but we strive to make a difference. That can look like volunteering, engaging in our community, and supporting others as they navigate the challenges of military life. We are also on a mission. We truly believe that we are fulfilling an important purpose. Military spouses are known for their resourcefulness, for creating strategies, and for executing plans. Surrogacy provides us with a similar sense of calling.” Listen to Tayler’s full podcast A Calling to Serve: An Interview with Military Spouse Tayler Lewis on Becoming a Surrogate. Read more stories from military spouseswho found their calling through surrogacy. How Surrogacy Fits into the Military Family Lifestyle Surrogacy is a process in which a woman carries a child who is not genetically related to her for someone else. The motive behind surrogacy—helping someone in the community who can’t have a child of their own—aligns well with the military family lifestyle in desiring to serve others. It offers significant financial compensation while providing the flexibility military families need to be present with their own family and do something that can be accomplished in the midst of frequent relocations.“I wanted to become a surrogate for as long as I can remember. After having two easy pregnancies, I felt it was time to share my super amazing ability as a woman to help a deserving family. At the time, my husband was stationed in Illinois on Recruiting Duty for the Marine Corps, so I took the opportunity to pursue my dream; he was supportive from the very beginning! Knowing that I could help create or grow a family was the most amazing feeling in the world.After a successful delivery of a baby girl, my heart was full and I knew my life had changed forever. I decided that surrogacy was something I was extremely passionate about, so I decided to pursue it in my career as well. Now, I work here at ConceiveAbilities as a Surrogate Engagement Coordinator, helping potential surrogates get started on their own surrogacy journeys. I can’t imagine a job more fulfilling and I am still able to help grow families every day.” Ashley Wilson, Experienced Surrogate, Mom of 2, Marine Wife Learn More About Surrogacy as a Military Wife",

    "content": "How to Ship Frozen Breast Milk Can you ship breast milk? Yes! Whether you are a new mother who is breastfeeding or you are a lactating surrogate who is preparing to ship breast milk to intended parents, you may be wondering how to ship breast milk. Working moms traveling for business may also find it beneficial to ship their milk home. No matter your reasons for wanting to ship breast milk, our team can help. We put together a comprehensive guide on how to mail breast milk effectively and safely, including some important do’s and don’ts on mailing breast milk, ensuring your milk arrives in the best condition while you focus on how to maintain and increase milk supply. Steps to Shipping Breast Milk First, select an insulated shipping container. You can search on platforms like Amazon for a container that is leakproof and structurally sound for transport. Collect your breast milk. First, label durable, BPA-free bags, bottles, or pouches with the date. Then, use a breast pump to fill them with milk, remove the excess air, and seal them. Be prepared to freeze them as soon as you finish this step.Pro Tip: As you’re filling your bags/bottles/pouches, leave some room in them; the milk will expand when frozen. Otherwise, they will burst. Once the milk is frozen, pack the breast milk in your insulated box as tightly as possible. The milk should go into the box first, then the other items to cool and insulate it. Shipping a smaller amount of milk? You can nestle it between layers of ice packs.Pro Tip: If the milk doesn’t fill the box, you’ll want to strategically load up the rest of the box. Add in packing material such as newspaper and then put the frozen gel packs or ice packs on top, cover it with a plastic bag, and then seal it in the box. Want even more peace of mind? Include a temperature monitoring device within your shipment, which can ensure the milk maintains a safe temperature. Finish packaging the shipment by taping it up with duct tape and labeling it. Label requirements may differ across courier services, so inquire about additional information if needed. There are additional methods for packing up your breast milk. For instance, you can use thick-walled Styrofoam coolers and cardboard boxes. Simply store your breast milk storage bags in the cooler and place them in the cardboard box or shipping box. Make sure to choose a cooler that is not too large but is large enough for the ice packs, insulation material, and breast milk. Watch our How To Pump, Ship and Donate Breast Milk Surrogacy Tutorial with Lactation Expert Lenna Gregory Do’s and Don’ts of Shipping Breast Milk Do: Use an insulated box. It needs to be sturdy, as well as able to withstand freezing and thawing. Pack tightly. You want to preserve the milk and prevent it from moving too much in transit. Label the package properly. As you’re writing your labels, indicate that the shipment includes frozen breast milk that is perishable. Breast milk is considered “liquid gold“ and must be treated as such! Ship overnight, as you want the breast milk to stay frozen in transit. DHL, FedEx, UPS, and USPS offer milk shipping services, so you can rest assured your shipment will maintain its temperature and be delivered quickly. You can also check out specialized organizations like Milk Stork that take care of shipping for you. Consider timing when shipping your breast milk. You will want to avoid shipping later in the week; weekend deliveries generally cost more, and on Sundays, there is no delivery service. Earlier in the week, such as on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, you are less likely to face delays. Update the recipient on shipping details. By providing the recipient with relevant tracking information, you can prepare them to accept your shipment and store the milk right away. Don’t: Freeze breast milk without removing air first. This can result in freezer burn. Use dry ice. It doesn’t melt, but rather, goes through sublimation. In other words, the dry ice changes from a solid to a gas. Because of this, pressure could build up in your package, and it could even explode in transit. Ship 2-day. Do not use 2-day services or ground service to ship milk. It will thaw. Because breast milk is perishable, it must be transported swiftly in a temperature-controlled environment. Make sure milk is being shipped by an overnight service that is guaranteed. Pack loosely. The contents of your package need to be snug. Bubble wrap, crumbled newspaper, and foam peanuts can be used for padding. If you need an alternative, you can purchase shipping kits from companies like Save the Milk. Pack and ship breast milk without researching local laws in your location and the recipient’s location. This is extremely important if you plan to ship breast milk internationally. Though it’s legal (and relatively straightforward) to ship breast milk within the United States, you may have to abide by additional requirements based on that specific country’s regulations.On a similar note, if you’re donating breast milk to a milk bank or hospital (especially the NICU), you will likely need to follow specific instructions from them as well. Handling Breast Milk Upon Delivery As long as milk is over 50% frozen when it arrives, it can be put into the freezer and be safe to feed to babies. Families receiving the milk should open the package and inspect the milk to make sure everything is frozen and in good condition. Then, they should freeze it immediately and use it within 6 months (if stored in the refrigerator freezer) or 12 months (if stored in the deep freezer). Of course, breast milk shipping experiences between women will be different. For example, service providers’ pricing—and how they determine shipping costs based on distance to the destination, package weight, and other factors—will vary. But, with careful planning, shipping frozen breast milk can be a smooth and rewarding experience, leaving you to concentrate on maintaining and increasing your milk supply. Looking for more guidance?

    "content": "At ConceiveAbilities, we have the honor of working alongside military spouses, every day, who dedicate themselves to serving others. Meet four of our military spouses: Tayler, Vanessa, Laci, and Ash. These ConceiveAbilities employees have supported their military spouses’ call to serve. Now, they are answering their own call to serve, by helping build families through surrogacy. This Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we celebrate these ConceiveAbilities employees who have served their communities in more ways than one. Read more about these incredible women below! Pictured: Ash and her husband Please tell us a bit about yourself: Tayler: My name is Tayler and I am a Surrogate Advisor at ConceiveAbilities. I have two beautiful children of my own and I proudly delivered a surrogate baby in 2022. In this season of my life, I am still discovering who I am beyond my roles as a spouse and mother. I’m a licensed skydiver, a former veterinary technician with a decade of experience, an avid adventure seeker, and, at my very core, I am an empath. My empathetic nature gives me a deep understanding of the emotions and experiences of others, which drives my desire to support and uplift those around me. Vanessa: My name is Vanessa. My husband and I have three amazing kids: Bradley (9), Arlyn (7), and Adler (2). As a family, we love to stay active by skiing or hiking as much as we can here in beautiful Colorado Springs, our favorite duty station. Ever since the birth of my first child, I have had a strong passion for birth. I quickly became a childbirth educator and doula to help serve other expecting moms in the cities we were stationed. Ultimately, my love for pregnancy and birth led me to pursue a surrogacy journey which I just completed in October 2023. Now, I have the joy of helping other women begin their surrogacy journeys as a Surrogate Advisor at ConceiveAbilities. Laci: My name is Laci Compton. I have been a surrogate through ConceiveAbilities and now work as a Surrogate Advisor! I live in New York State with my husband and our two daughters Lila and Holland! We have a small zoo with two cats, one dog, and a hamster and we are looking to add chickens this year. We are Montana natives but our heart is in Alaska and we cannot wait to get back there someday when my husband retires. Ash: My name is Ash Golike! I’m originally from California but I have lived in the Southeast for 8 years. We recently PCS’d (Permanent Change of Station) to Fort Campbell and live in Tennessee. My husband and I are high school sweethearts, and together we have two kiddos, Izzy (8) and Isaac (3). As a family we enjoy kayaking, hiking, exploring new places or simply snuggling up on the couch to read a good book or watch a fun movie. I work as a Health Information Specialist at ConceiveAbilities. What branch of service is your spouse in? Tayler: My husband, Mason, was a sergeant and served in the United States Army as a firearms instructor and a cargo specialist. He served for 8 years. Vanessa: My husband Mike is in the Air Force. We are almost to the 20 year mark! Looking forward to retirement, and hoping to never move again. Laci: My husband is a Warrant Officer in the Army and he works as a Blackhawk Pilot. Ash: My husband is in the Army. He started out as a combat engineer but just recently became a Medevac Helicopter Pilot. Pictured: Tayler and her husband, Mason Did being a military spouse influence your decision to help build families by becoming a surrogate? Tayler: Being a military spouse had a significant impact on my decision to help build families through ConceiveAbilities, in addition to my own personal reasons for embarking on such a journey). I conducted extensive research and followed other military spouses sharing their experiences. ConceiveAbilities was full of selfless women on a mission to build families and also offered the most incredible support system I could have asked for. These women understood the journey both as mothers and military spouses, providing a sense of camaraderie and encouragement that made all the difference. Vanessa: Being a military spouse, it’s in our DNA to serve and help others. I have met so many amazing families over the years and the struggle of infertility has always been on my heart. I wanted a way to tangibly help. Laci: Absolutely! Military spouses tend to stand in the shadow of their soldiers. I wanted something of my own and to give back in any way I could. I now work for ConceiveAbilities since my journey gave me so much joy and I knew I wanted to turn that into a career. As a full-time employee, I have taken this job with me to four states as we moved for my husband’s career. Ash: I have not been a surrogate, but I am honored to work with surrogates every day. As a military spouse, my husband’s career and our life together has always centered around putting others first. It’s a sacrifice we have both made in our own roles as a service member and a spouse. Because of this, I’ve always gravitated towards wanting to help others and making a positive impact wherever I go. The most magical moment in my life is when I became a mom. Although each journey to parenthood is unique, there is no beauty that shines brighter than that of a surrogate with a good heart willing to make dreams come true. Pictured: Laci and family How has your experience as a surrogate changed your life? Tayler: From 2021 to 2022, I was a surrogate with ConceiveAbilities. This was an experience I had discussed with my husband since giving birth to our last child. As a military spouse, I resonate with words like “serve,” “calling,” and “purpose.” We may not serve in the same capacity as our active-duty partners but we strive to make a difference. This can involve volunteering, engaging in our community, or supporting others as they navigate the challenges of military life. When we take action, we truly believe we are fulfilling an important purpose. When you blend that sense of mission with the desire to help others through surrogacy, it brings about a profound and loving fulfillment, providing a genuine sense of life-changing purpose. It was empowering to know that I could “serve” in my own way: I could financially contribute to our family and, no matter where the Army sent us, I could pick up those roots and plant them where we were called next. Vanessa: Surrogacy has always been on my heart after a fellow military spouse needed the help of a gestational carrier. We were stationed back to back in non-surrogacy friendly states, but finally landed in Colorado where I was able to pursue a journey after the birth of our third baby. Laci: Surrogacy was the most rewarding experience of my life. At the time, I had just decided to stop working to be home full-time with our two-year-old. I knew I always wanted to explore surrogacy because I wanted to share the gift of maintaining a healthy pregnancy that came to me so easily. I knew others struggled but what I did not expect was the immense sense of purpose it gave me. I felt like I was not only contributing to my family financially but I belonged to something so much greater than myself that we all took part in! Pictured: Vanessa and her Intended Parents How has your work and/or experience with ConceiveAbilities help you serve others? Tayler: Helping build families as a military spouse, surrogate, and employee with ConceiveAbilities has been a deeply personal way for me to serve others. I often meet applicants who share the lifestyle I experienced for 28 years and I have the privilege of guiding them through the screening process as one of the first people they connect with on their journeys. Beyond my professional role, I aim to be a true friend to these women. I offer advice and support with a sense of empathy and understanding, as someone who has walked a similar path. Vanessa: Being able to help another family grow was such a joy! I’m excited to help other families through my role with ConceiveAbilities. Laci: We now consider our former “Intended Parents” family. We are unbelievably close and get to go through life together celebrating this boy we brought into the world. This has impacted me greatly and is the most rewarding experience of my life. Being a surrogate was my way to serve and being an employee with ConceiveAbilities is how I continue to serve. Every day I get to help build families; what is better than that? Ash: ConceiveAbilities is so special to me because it allows me to serve families who might be in need and to invest in surrogates who are passionately wanting to be the light for others. Inspired by our military spouses? If you are a military spouse and are called to become a surrogate, we have resources for you, including other military spouses who you can connect with.

    "content": "Nurse Appreciation Week is the perfect time to shine a spotlight on the unsung heroes of healthcare: nurses who tirelessly devote themselves to helping build families. At ConceiveAbilities, we are proud to have fifteen amazing nurses on our team who dedicate themselves to guiding our surrogates and families through the surrogacy process. It is our privilege to take a moment to recognize the remarkable contributions of each of our nurses on staff who go above and beyond each day to make a difference. We highlight here just four of our very special ConceiveAbilities nurses who bring their expertise to helping build families: Kelly, Erica, Kristina, and Nicole, experienced nurses with a combined 75 years of nursing experience and two of whom were surrogates themselves!! Why did you answer the call to become a nurse? Kelly: I was actually a pre-med student and getting ready to take my MCATs. A short hospital stay and having an incredible nurse care for me started turning my wheels and I began to ask myself what exactly I wanted to do in healthcare. A short time later I transferred into the nursing program and have been a nurse now for thirty two years. Erica: My mom works in the medical field and growing up I would sometimes go with her to her patient’s house. I found that I have always enjoyed helping others and when I had my children, I knew that Obstetrics was where I was supposed to be. I have now been a nurse for six years. I knew that God wanted me to be the support person for women and families experiencing the joy and heartbreak of labor and delivery. Kristina: I have had the honor of being a nurse for eighteen years and a nurse practitioner for five years. Prior to becoming a nurse, I had worked for an insurance company processing health and dental claims and then for two additional companies in health information technology. While I enjoyed my work, I felt a strong pull to become a nurse, to give of myself and to make a difference in someone’s life. Nicole: Growing up the oldest in my family, I was always looking out and taking care of my younger brothers. I have always shown compassion and empathy and enjoy helping others. Becoming a nurse fourteen years ago was the perfect extension of that. How has being a nurse impacted your life for the better? Kelly: Being a nurse has given me so many amazing opportunities for growth, allowed me to do something I love while still being home and available for my kids (including many many years on nights), fueled my inquisitive mind for medical research, and gave me the tools to teach other aspiring nurses. Erica: Nursing has brought many wonderful people into my life. Friendships in the nursing world are founded on a bond of trust and mutual commitment to improving human life and I am eternally grateful for the relationships I have made in my career. Kristina: Being a nurse and a nurse practitioner has brought fulfillment and purpose to my life. It allows me to care for others in their time of need and to promote health and wellbeing. Nicole: I have been able to experience the joys of becoming parents with my patients and made so many amazing connections with people throughout my nursing career. How did being a nurse impact your decision to become a surrogate and how did it change your life? Erica: My passion for nursing played a significant role in leading me to become a surrogate. Assisting families has always brought me immense joy, and I believe that surrogacy is the ultimate way to make a positive impact on creating families. In labor and delivery, I have seen many people struggle to have a child and the joy they experience when that finally happens is beyond words. I knew early on that I wanted to be able to help another family experience that joy. I knew I wanted to take an active role in helping someone achieve their dream of growing their family. Surrogacy was the answer for me! There is no greater joy than being a part of this process. The extended families that I have formed though the process of surrogacy are ones that I will cherish forever. Kristina: I am a three-time surrogate, having carried a total of five babies for three different couples. As a labor and delivery nurse, I had a deep knowledge of the pregnancy process and I knew that I would have the support not only of my friends and family but from my nurse colleagues…..and my obstetricians whom I worked alongside everyday at the hospital. I’ve always felt a pull or calling towards obstetrics and truly been enamored by the miracle of life. Creating my family had been relatively easy and I was more than aware that for many that is not the case. I had been raised to give back, to volunteer, to ‘do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.’ I felt that if I could do something like this for someone else, why wouldn’t I? Would I have wanted someone to do the same for me if the situation was reversed? How has your nursing background expanded your capacity to care for others while working with ConceiveAbilities? Kelly: As a nurse at ConceiveAbilities, I am helping to ensure our surrogates have been medically screened and can safely move forward in the process. Ensuring safety, building trust, showing empathy, and rejoicing when the goal is met (sounds like a nurse caring for a patient, right?) are all actions of caring. And each of these actions are stepping stones that create a path for helping to build families. Erica: Nursing and surrogacy have allowed me to fulfill my calling of helping build families whether it’s through support in labor and delivery or the postpartum period or being entrusted to carry someone’s precious gift as a surrogate. Kristina: I like to think that as a surrogate I was able to lighten the load of worries for each of my three sets of intended parents. It enabled me to bring happiness into their lives. As an employee of ConceiveAbilities these past 12 years, I’ve been able to care for surrogates through the education and support I have provided throughout their application process. Nicole: As a ConceiveAbilities employee, I know that we are all working together to care for our surrogates and intended parents as they go through one of life’s biggest moments. Happy Nurse Appreciation Week to all nurses, and especially to Kelly, Erica, Kristina, Nicole, and all of our nurses on the ConceiveAbilities staff! Inspired by our nurses?

Whether you are a new mother who is breastfeeding or you are a lactating surrogate who is preparing to ship breast milk to intended parents, you may be wondering how to ship breast milk. Working moms traveling for business may also find it beneficial to ship their milk home. No matter your reasons for wanting to ship breast milk, our team can help. We put together a comprehensive guide on how to mail breast milk effectively and safely, including some important do’s and don’ts on mailing breast milk, ensuring your milk arrives in the best condition while you focus on how to maintain and increase milk supply. Steps to Shipping Breast Milk First, select an insulated shipping container. You can search on platforms like Amazon for a container that is leakproof and structurally sound for transport. Collect your breast milk. First, label durable, BPA-free bags, bottles, or pouches with the date. Then, use a breast pump to fill them with milk, remove the excess air, and seal them. Be prepared to freeze them as soon as you finish this step.Pro Tip: As you’re filling your bags/bottles/pouches, leave some room in them; the milk will expand when frozen. Otherwise, they will burst. Once the milk is frozen, pack the breast milk in your insulated box as tightly as possible. The milk should go into the box first, then the other items to cool and insulate it. Shipping a smaller amount of milk? You can nestle it between layers of ice packs.Pro Tip: If the milk doesn’t fill the box, you’ll want to strategically load up the rest of the box. Add in packing material such as newspaper and then put the frozen gel packs or ice packs on top, cover it with a plastic bag, and then seal it in the box. Want even more peace of mind? Include a temperature monitoring device within your shipment, which can ensure the milk maintains a safe temperature. Finish packaging the shipment by taping it up with duct tape and labeling it. Label requirements may differ across courier services, so inquire about additional information if needed. There are additional methods for packing up your breast milk. For instance, you can use thick-walled Styrofoam coolers and cardboard boxes. Simply store your breast milk storage bags in the cooler and place them in the cardboard box or shipping box. Make sure to choose a cooler that is not too large but is large enough for the ice packs, insulation material, and breast milk.

    "content": "How Long Should You Supply Breast Milk to Intended Parents? As a surrogate, you might be considering providing breast milk postpartum for your intended parents and wondering how to maintain and increase milk supply during this time. his will be a shared decision between you and your intended parents to choose what is best for you, based on what works best for everyone involved. Ultimately, there is no one correct answer to this question; however, there are numerous factors to consider, including the methods you’ll use to maintain and increase milk supply effectively. Assessing Intended Parent Needs The length of time in which you provide breast milk is a shared decision between the surrogate and the intended parents. It will depend on how long the intended parents want breast milk and how long you, as the surrogate, wants to pump. Together, you will decide what the optimal length of time you will provide breast milk. Because breast milk offers a host of health benefits, your intended parents may want it for as long as possible. Newborn babies will not require as much milk; however, as they grow, they will become hungrier and need a larger amount of milk. That being said, the more you pump, the more your body produces. If you are not providing breast milk for your intended family, the intended mother can also breastfeed. Should they need breastfeeding support, they can utilize a Supplemental Nursing System (SNS). Another option is formula feeding. If your intended family does not choose to have you provide breast milk for their baby, you may choose to suppress lactation. You may also choose to continue your giving journey and donate your breast milk. Assessing Surrogate Needs Additionally, you must also consider how long you, as a surrogate, would want to provide breast milk. You have your own unique milk supply you can offer to the baby, but pumping can be a time-consuming, physically challenging, and emotionally challenging process. You may even experience irritation and soreness through your pumping journey. Plus, if you are not local to your intended parents, you will need to evaluate how often you will need to ship breast milk to them. Here are some tips from lactation expert Lenna Gregory on How to Pump, Ship and Donate Your Breast Milk. Understanding The Breast Milk Pumping Timeline If you are still thinking about how long to provide breast milk, gaining a better understanding of the general pumping timeline can be helpful. During Pregnancy & The First Days Milk production begins as soon as the second trimester; your body starts producing colostrum, the first type of breast milk in preparation for providing nourishment after birth. After delivery, you will begin to pump breast milk, and you will be providing transitional milk for about a couple weeks, which is when mature milk typically comes in.As far as baby feeds go, at first, feeding sessions will likely be every two to three hours, though these can start to spread out after the baby’s first week. Keep in mind that, during this time, babies will go through cluster feeding phases. The First Month to 6 Months Old Exclusive breast milk is recommended for the first six months of an infant’s life. Babies will go through growth spurts during this time and may continue to cluster feed. After this time period, they can continue to have breast milk with the introduction of solid foods through their first year or so How to Maintain and Increase Your Milk Supply To maintain and increase your milk supply while pumping breast milk, it’s essential to pump regularly, ideally every 2-3 hours, to effectively mimic your baby’s natural feeding schedule. Using a high-quality breast pump with the correct flange size ensures efficient milk extraction, which helps maintain and increase your milk supply. Staying hydrated, eating a balanced diet, and reducing stress also play a significant role in supporting your milk production. Additionally, incorporating gentle breast massage can stimulate milk flow, further helping to maintain and increase your milk supply. If challenges arise, consulting a lactation consultant can provide tailored advice to optimize your pumping routine.

So, When Is The Right Time? Deciding on the length of time you will provide breast milk is a personal decision. When it comes to their little one, no matter if they are with breast milk, formula, or both, as the saying goes, “fed is best”. Have additional questions about breastfeeding and breast milk?

    "content": "The world of surrogacy is changing rapidly. Yet, not all the words and terms are keeping pace. ConceiveAbilities is committed to refining our process to not only keep up with, but continuing to lead the surrogacy world. And what we hear A LOT from surrogates and intended mothers and families alike, is a simple truth. They do not like to be called a surrogate mother. The term surrogate mother is outdated, even when well-intentioned…and most importantly, not a true representation of modern surrogacy. The surrogate, or gestational carrier, is not the mother. Period. She shares no DNA or genetic relation to the child she is carrying. She will have undergone IVF treatment to receive the embryo of the intended parents; that embryo will have been created with the intended parents’ and/or donor egg and sperm. As one surrogate shared, she is the babysitter, not the mother. We surveyed our experienced surrogates about the term surrogate mother. 80% said they feel the term mother should be dropped completely. Here is what they say you need to know: The surrogate is not the mother.The surrogate is in no way genetically related to the child she is carrying. She does not share any DNA with the child she is carrying. The child a surrogate carries is the intended parent(s)’ child. “I am not the mother of the baby at all,” says surrogate Teale Kelley. Elizabeth Foley says dropping the term “mother” removes the parental feel, saying “I’m just the babysitter until the baby can go home to his parents.” Mother should be saved for the mom.Women become a surrogate to help another person experience the joys of parenthood. They know this is not their baby and they want to ensure that the mother of the child receives the proper title. Samantha Smith feels the word “mother” takes away from the intended mom because “she is still the mother even if she is not carrying the child and should be recognized as so.“ Another surrogate shares, “The mother may already feel that she is losing a lot by needing to use a surrogate and calling someone a surrogate mother can affect the actual mother’s feelings.” It feeds into surrogate myths.Many surrogates think the word mother confuses people and further feeds surrogacy myths and misconceptions. Two-time surrogate Melissa Enke says using the term “mother” makes people think the baby was partially hers. Another surrogate says it leads to the question “how do you not feel horrible giving up a baby?” adding, “I’m not giving up the child, because I’m never the parent.” Elizabeth Foley also feels that the term “mother” leads to questions about her keeping the baby, “Other than the fact that it is actually the largest contract violation, this concept of wanting to keep the baby is inaccurate. Continuing to use the term surrogate mother will cause these misperceptions to carry on and prevent the public from being properly educated on the truly complex process that is gestational surrogacy.” It can be damaging.Oftentimes, intended parents have had an extremely challenging infertility journey and referring to the surrogate as a mother can be hurtful. Through surrogacy, they are able to build their family with a trusted partner. One surrogate shared, “It’s important to me that I am not viewed as the mother. The term mother should be reserved for the actual mother.” Molly Corcoran says she is already planning ahead for her next delivery saying, “I had a delivery at the hospital where I was being called mom by the clinical staff and I had to correct them multiple times. My next journey I put in the birth plan that was given to the hospital to refer to me by my first name.” The surrogate is just the babysitter. She is not the mother.As the number one surrogacy myth, It’s worth repeating. To put a complex matter in a cute way: it is the surrogate’s oven, but not their bun. That said, surrogates are caring and nurturing women. Deanna Mitchell says, “As a surrogate, you care for the baby you are carrying as if it were your own, to substitute as best as possible for how the intended mother would love and care for her baby if she were able to carry it on her own.” 100% of the women we surveyed said they prefer to be called a surrogate, gestational surrogate or gestational carrier (“GC”) without the word mother. So why do we still use the term “Surrogate Mother” on our website? Because we want to share surrogacy with as many people as we possibly can to help grow families. Hear us out. Our research indicates that over 1.3 million women in the United States would be both willing and qualified to be surrogates – if they were educated and knowledgeable about the topic. For those women that are at the earliest stages of learning about surrogacy, they frequently use the term “Surrogate Mother” to search for information about surrogacy. In fact, “Surrogate Mother” is the third highest used search term people use while learning about surrogacy. Following closely behind are these phrases: “What is A Surrogate Mother,” “Surrogate Mother Meaning” and “Surrogate Mother Definition.” Surrogacy can be complex when someone is first introduced to it. Because our goal is to be a leading resource for people who want to learn more about surrogacy, we do use the term “Surrogate Mother” with the intention of helping them get the best information so they can make an informed decision. And, once we have their attention, we help them learn why this particular term is one to be left in the rearview mirror. Curious about how you can help build families by being a surrogate?

The impacts of this shortage still persist. “In our work to help build families for more than twenty-five years, we know that many women find purpose in helping other families at a time of great need,” shared Founder Nazca Fontes, adding, “Like surrogacy, milk banks play a vital role in supporting families. We stand ready to assist all women who are able to help lift up other women, mothers, and families and help provide much needed nutrition to their babies. While there is – yet still – so much work to be done to address the infant formula shortage, we hope an increase of breast milk donations will be a lifeline for these families at this critical time.” Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services, adds, “Our surrogates are incredibly giving and often donate their breast milk after their surrogacy journey. By inspiring more women to donate, we hope those who are facing this uncertainty can rest easy at night knowing they can provide critical nutrition for their babies.” More Resources for Lactating Women: Do you need help finding lactation consultant services?

    "content": "What Is The Definition of Infertility The American Society of Reproduction (ASRM) has redefined infertility to be inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. Infertility is defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner and is inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. In patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at six months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. Nothing in this definition shall be used to deny or delay treatment to any individual, regardless of relationship status or sexual orientation. There are many fertility treatments available for people experiencing infertility: the most successful being surrogacy. Redefining Infertility to Celebrate Every Surrogacy Journey The broadened infertility definition opens doors for more same-sex couples and single individuals to access assisted reproductive technologies, marking a beacon of hope and opportunity. This change is particularly significant, given that some insurance plans rely on ASRM’s definition of infertility to approve fertility treatments. Learn more about infertility. We Are Proud of Our History Helping Hundreds of LGTBQ+ and Single People Have Families As a pioneering surrogacy agency committed to supporting all who aspire to build a family, ConceiveAbilities applauds a groundbreaking development in the United States. The official definition of infertility has undergone a significant expansion, offering newfound hope and opportunities to a wider range of individuals, particularly within the LGBTQ+ community and among single parents. ConceiveAbilities Founder Nazca Fontes, a passionate advocate for modern family-building, enthusiastically lauds the latest initiative by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). This move recognizes and caters to the unique needs of same-sex and single parent communities, marking a monumental step toward inclusivity in the field of reproductive health. “We have always believed everyone who wants to be a parent should be able to. Over our 27 year history, we have assisted hundreds of LGBTQ+ and single people achieve their dreams of parenthood. We wholeheartedly commend ASRM’s latest development in recognizing the need to modernize the definition to include same-sex and single parent communities.” Surrogate Whitney Anderson says this change is a glimmer of hope for all LGBTQ+ families, saying, “I became a surrogatespecifically to help an LGBTQ+ family and I am honored to help them start their family. This new definition for infertility will allow more people to fulfill their dreams of parenthood.” According to Dr. Mark Leondires, Medical Director of Illume Fertility and Founder of Gay Parents To Be, this is a significant step forward for the LGBTQ+ community. He states, “It is a personal passion of mine to help move the needle for the LGBTQ+ community to be able to have children who are an expression of somebody’s love for their partner. As a gay dad myself, I understand how hard it is to get started on a surrogacy journey. This new definition of infertility makes it all the more possible.” The New Inclusive Infertility Definition Makes Parenthood a Reality for LGBTQ+ and Single Communities “Every person, regardless of marital status or sexual preference, with the desire to become a parent should have equal access to the benefits and opportunities to safely and effectively build their family. Today’s definition makes this a reality,” details Gina-Marie Madow, Director of Legal Services for ConceiveAbilities. This crucial decision is designed to offer vital support to same-sex couples and single individuals who have encountered barriers to their fertility treatment claims, marking a step toward a more inclusive and compassionate approach to reproductive health and family-building for all. ConceiveAbilities proudly supports and commends this progressive change. ConceiveAbilities is proudly certified by the Family Equality Council as an official Open Door LGBTQ+ family building agency.

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, where I metmy husband in high school. After high school my husband joined the Air Force and I followed him toCalifornia. There we had our amazing son, Isaac, who is 8 years old and our wonderfully sweetdaughter, Harper, who is almost 6. We are growing our roots here in Colorado and loving it. As afamily we enjoy hiking the mountains and playing board games. My personal hobbies include cooking,baking, and creating art. CHRISTINA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY Becoming a gestational surrogate wasn’t a decision I took lightly; it was the culmination of a deepdesire to help others experience the joy of parenthood. My journey into surrogacy began with a simplethought: What if I could be the one to make someone’s dream of having a child come true? Read more about Christina’s decision to become a surrogate not only once, but twice! WHAT MAKES CHRISTINA COURAGEOUS In a world that often seems divided, my journey as a gestational surrogate has taught me that thegreatest gift we can give one another is the gift of love and compassion. It’s about reaching out to helpthose in need, even if they are strangers, and uniting in the beautiful journey of creating families. CHRISTINA’S PURPOSE: The birth of my two children were single handedly the best days of my life. Both of my children’spregnancies were very much planned for and wanted and watching them grow and become their ownpeople is such a rewarding experience. The idea that a friend or family member may go without theamazing, humbling experience of parenthood when they deeply desired it was heartbreaking. Howcould I not step up to help them if I was able? One day while I was browsing the internet an ad forConceiveabilities popped up and I quickly discovered that this selfless act extended beyond ourimmediate circles. I realized that I could help complete strangers on their path to parenthood, and thisrevelation was truly life-changing. If I would help a friend, why was a stranger any different?

    "content": "As told by Brelani Jiminez, ConceiveAbilities Surrogate Why did you decide to become a surrogate?I decided to become a surrogate because of two main reasons: I naturally had easy pregnancies/deliveries and I had a desire to share the indescribable feeling when I held my babies for the first time. I decided that I would love to provide this moment for another couple who has been desiring the opportunity to hold their own babies for so long. What role did your faith play into your decision?After many years of research, discussions with mentors and a lot of prayer, my husband and I decided to pursue surrogacy for many reasons. We think of this journey as adding to our testimony of how beautiful our God is. We had a feeling coming into this that our Intended Parents would have already had a hard and difficult journey. We prayed God would place us in a position to be a beacon of light and a vessel for the Holy Spirit for not only our intended parents, but for all of those that we would come in contact with along the way. We wanted to be a glimmer of hope and light in what would feel like a dark world – and to have the opportunity to share the love of Jesus to a complete stranger, for it is mentioned in the Bible in Acts 20:35, “In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’” To show others that when science and all that mankind can provide has put everything on the table, there is nothing else to credit besides God. How did you share your decision to become a surrogate with your religious community?I decided to share my journey with all (those who are followers of Jesus Christ and those who are not) via social media and by word of mouth. We made this decision to publicly share so that others may find hope in dark places. I love to provide transparency and show others how God has worked absolute wonders in my life and continues to do so everyday. I haven’t had the easiest journey as I envisioned having my first transfer being successful. While my journey has actually been a bit difficult, I have been able to publicly show the many ups and downs throughout this part of my life. How God has helped carry me through has been such a blessing. All of what we have been through and continue to go through will be to bring honor and glory to God. How do you handle negative comments regarding your decision to become a surrogate?I haven’t had many negative comments regarding my decision to become a surrogate, but I have had a lot of questions brought to my attention. The one negative reaction I can recall was from another Christian who told me that she had a message from God. She shared that surrogacy is the way of this world and to turn my focus on God to share His love and light in other ways. She went on to suggest that the idea of me partaking in surrogacy was a role of “playing God.” The message ended with God understanding where my heart is upon this action and He values this; however, the action is incorrect and taking on the ways of this world. When she shared this message, I was heartbroken and distraught for quite a while. As many other Christians would agree, I would never want to violate the will of God, let alone dive right into disobedience head first. My intentions were to never attempt to “play God.” My reasoning to pursue surrogacy was the exact opposite; to share the gospel and His love for His children. I wanted to be a light for God in a dark world filled with hurt and brokenness. Through prayer, reading scripture, meditation, application and some extra prayers, I have come to the realization there will be naysayers, there will be messengers, there will be those who doubt this is the correct way of God’s will. In the end I remember this: my relationship with Jesus Christ and doing the work of the Lord comes down to me, myself, and God. Was it important for you to match with intended parents of the same faith?It was not as important for me to match with intended parents of the same faith; however, it is important to me to abide and align myself with what Biblical principles describe as a couple. Being open to all intended parents no matter their faith while aligning within Biblical principles provides an opportunity for me to love God’s children, to share the light with those who are willing to listen, and hopefully plant a seed in leading them to Christ. What would be your one message to potential surrogates struggling with this decision because of their faith?My one message to women struggling with this decision because of their faith would be: take the leap of faith. Let this be a testimony to God and allow an opportunity to show how powerful and all-knowing He is. As long as your heart posture is in the right place, becoming a surrogate is not an attempt of going against God’s will because, in the end, God still has complete control over all including the results of your surrogacy journey. What better way to demonstrate a glimpse of our Living Hope than to be a vessel for the Holy Spirit and provide a blessing to another couple in a way that could never truly be reciprocated. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family?

    "content": "U.S. Surrogacy Laws By State By Fran Caruso, Esq. ConceiveAbilities is your trusted resource for all things surrogacy including guidance through the legal process. Surrogacy laws vary from state to state and even sometimes county to county. That is why, in addition to our own internal team of expert attorneys, ConceiveAbilities partners with local, state specific attorneys who specialize in reproductive law. Surrogacy laws are ever-changing, but we are here to ensure you feel informed, comfortable, and assured as you proceed forward with the legal process. Below is a brief overview of the current laws impacting surrogacy in relevant states. We are always here to provide additional information and answer your questions so that you can feel confident from the legal perspective as you embark on a surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities. Illinois Illinois is ConceiveAbilities’ home base! In Illinois, gestational surrogacy is permitted via statute and allows intended parents(s) to be declared the legal parent(s) upon birth of the child as long as one intended parent is a genetic contributor to the child. As such, legal parentage is determined upon birth and intended parents can obtain a birth certificate from vital statistics directly. If the statute’s requirements are not met, or if a court order is needed for other reasons, then parentage may be determined via a post-birth order. Finally, if both egg donor and sperm donor are used, parental rights would be obtained via an adoption proceeding.Get more information about surrogacy in Illinois. New York As of February 15, 2021, compensated gestational surrogacy was made legal in New York via its new statute: the Child Parent Security Act (CPSA). The CPSA includes the Surrogate’s Bill of Rights–the first of its kind in the industry–as well as many requirements for the gestational carrier agreements. You can learn more about the CPSA and its impact on the surrogacy industry here.Notably, ConceiveAbilities was one of the first surrogacy agencies to be licensed by the New York Department of Health. To comply with the CPSA, ConceiveAbilities ensures that its intended parents and gestational carriers have experienced, well-versed reproductive attorneys who are knowledgeable of the CPSA. Under the CPSA, New York courts will grant pre-birth orders for all intended parents regardless of genetic contributors, marital status, or sexual orientation who are parties to a compensated surrogacy arrangement; and the order will go into effect at the time of the birth.Get more information about surrogacy in New York. Colorado Gestational surrogacy is legal in Colorado via the Colorado Surrogacy Agreement Act. The law protects both the intended parents and the gestational carrier who have entered into gestational carrier agreements consistent with the law. ConceiveAbilities ensures that during the drafting of the gestational carrier agreement all parties are represented by attorneys licensed in Colorado as is required by the law. Intended parents can proceed with a gestational carrier in Colorado regardless of their marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or need for surrogacy. Parentage can be determined via a pre-birth order from the juvenile court and said order will vest the intended parents with all parental rights and duties to the child immediately upon birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Colorado. California California is often thought of as the “friendliest” state for surrogacy and for good reason—California was the first state to enact a statute that makes surrogacy available to all! And while there are other states that are similarly as supportive and legally secure, California remains one of the most sought after states for surrogacy. Intended Parents, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy, can obtain a pre-birth order. This is true so long as any portion of the surrogacy occurred in California–specifically: (1) the county where the child is anticipated to be born, (2) the county where the intended parent(s) reside, (3) the county where the gestational carrier resides, (4) the county where the assisted reproduction agreement for gestational carrier is executed, or (5) the county where medical procedures pursuant to the GCA (i.e. embryo transfers) are to be performed. The pre-birth order becomes effective at the moment of birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Southern California and Northern California Oregon Although there are no specific surrogacy laws in Oregon, there are laws that contemplate the relationship between the intended parent(s) and a child conceived via assisted reproductive technology. Furthermore, there are no specific statutes or case law that prohibit surrogacy. Surrogacy is safely practiced in Oregon and is available to any and all types of intended parents who will legally be declared the parents of the child. Most judges issue pre-birth orders if there is a genetic connection between the intended parent(s) and child and in some cases even when there is not a genetic connection. Post-birth orders are also available if needed.Get more information about surrogacy in Oregon. Washington Rounding out the surrogacy friendly states of the west coast is Washington. As of January 1, 2019, Washington enacted a parentage statute that provides for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders. Pre-birth orders are granted regardless of the intended parent(s) marital status, sexual preference, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy. Pre-birth orders go into effect upon the birth of the child. Washington law defines who can be a “gestational surrogate” and provides specific details as to what terms need to be included in the gestational carrier for it to be enforceable. Specifically, a gestational carrier may not have completed more than two (2) surrogacies.Therefore, for all parties’ protection, it is critical that intended parents and gestational carriers work with experienced surrogacy professionals, like those at ConceiveAbilities, who are well versed in the specific requirements in Washington.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington. Minnesota Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Minnesota as no statute or published case law prohibits surrogacy. Surrogacy is available to Intended Parents regardless of marital status or genetic connection. Although many courts in several counties will grant pre-birth declaratory judgments, the more likely course of action is that parentage will be determined post-birth, especially if donor material was used. The relevant paperwork can be filed pre-birth, but it will not be granted until after birth. Additionally, a hearing is oftentimes required by the presiding judge meaning that all parties should anticipate remaining in Minnesota until the necessary legal work is completed. Arguably the most notable aspect of surrogacy in Minnesota is that if a judge will not sign a pre-birth declaratory judgment, a non-genetic parent will need to obtain a second parent adoption post-birth to confer parental rights. While the optics of this is not ideal, as it is the intended parents’ child, it is a critical step to ensure that all intended parents have equal legal rights to their child. The second parent adoption is typically completed quickly after birth in conjunction with the other post-birth legal proceedings in order to ensure both parents are named on the birth certificate.Get more information about surrogacy in Minnesota. Massachusetts Gestational surrogacy is supported in Massachusetts by three notable cases decided by the Commonwealth’s superior Court – Hodas v. Morin (2004); Culliton v. Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr. (2002); and R.R. v. M.H. (1998). Married and unmarried couples and single individuals, regardless of sexual orientation and/or genetic connection, may obtain a pre-birth order. A hearing is typically not required but is ultimately up to the judge’s discretion.Get more information about surrogacy in Massachusetts. Nevada Not to be outdone by its neighboring state of California, Nevada also has a surrogacy statute that permits gestational surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need. Pre-birth and post-birth orders are available. The Nevada statute specifically provides that parties may enter into gestational carrier agreements which contemplate payment of consideration for surrogacy services. The statute also requires that the gestational carrier agreement expressly state that the gestational carrier and her legal spouse/partner relinquish all rights and duties to the child conceived through assisted reproduction and that it is the intended parent(s) who are the parents of any resulting child. While the gestational carrier agreement would already state this regardless of the prevailing state law, Nevada has appropriately made this a statutory requirement for any gestational carrier agreement. Way to go Nevada!Get more information about surrogacy in Nevada. Pennsylvania Although there is no surrogacy statute in Pennsylvania, gestational surrogacy is still permitted and practiced. Pennsylvania declared in a 2006 case that a surrogacy contract is not contrary to public policy and that the gestational carrier is not the “legal mother.” Furthermore, in 2015, the Superior Court confirmed the enforceability of gestational carrier agreements as well as intended parents legal parentage to the child regardless of any genetic connection. Pre-birth orders are available, although this sometimes varies based on the specific county and judge, particularly if donor material is used. However, thanks to these court decisions, parties can safely proceed with gestational surrogacy in Pennsylvania.Get more information about surrogacy in Pennsylvania. Maryland Maryland has been a favorable state for gestational surrogacy since 2003. Similar to other states, parties are able to safely practice gestational surrogacy thanks to a favorable court decision (as compared to an explicit statute). Maryland’s highest court implicitly approved gestational surrogacy by determining that a gestational carrier is not required to be listed as the “mother” on the birth certificate of the child thereby leading to having the intended parents exclusively listed. Regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection, Intended Parents are able to establish their parental rights pre-birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Maryland. Georgia Despite no statutory or case law directly addressing surrogacy contracts in Georgia, it is a favorable state for gestational surrogacy. Courts regularly establish parental rights for Intended Parents through a pre-birth declaratory judgment regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic connection (although there may be additional paperwork required). The court process is typically very seamless – everything is usually handled directly between attorneys and usually no in-person hearing is required, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Georgia. Virginia Many are surprised to learn that surrogacy is authorized by statute in Virginia. Virginia’s “Status of Children of Assisted Conception” is unique because although it contemplates court approval process, this can only be done prior to embryo transfer and is not a pre-birth parentage order. It is instead a lengthy court process more akin to an adoption proceeding–home studies for all parties, the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the unborn child, and a full trial-like court hearing. Therefore, almost all Intended Parents bypass this and opt to establish their parental rights post-birth either through the administrative process contemplated in the statute or an order of parentage from the court. One other unique note for Virginia, the gestational carrier cannot sign any of the documents until 72 hours after the child is born. Finally, Virginia has a marital requirement for couples pursuing gestational surrogacy, but there need not be any genetic connection so long as ownership of the embryo can be proven. Ohio As of 2007, the Ohio Supreme Court has confirmed that gestational surrogacy is not against public policy and therefore gestational surrogacy is readily practiced in Ohio. While pre-birth orders are granted, they are discretionary meaning they are somewhat variable depending on the county. However, most counties will issue a pre-birth order for married Intended Parents, unmarried heterosexual couples, or singles regardless of sexual orientation or genetics. If not possible, Intended Parents can obtain a post-birth order to secure their parental rights.Get more information about surrogacy in Ohio. North Carolina Gestational surrogacy is practiced in North Carolina as there is no prohibition of it by either case law or statute. While most intended parents are able to obtain a pre-birth parentage, in some rare occasions parentage may be determined post-birth. The biggest factor is the intended parents’ marital status and genetic connection to the child. One specificity as to North Carolina gestational surrogacy is that when a known donor is used, the donor will also to be a party to the parentage legal proceedings. Nevertheless, single genetic parents, married and unmarried heterosexual couples with at least one genetic parent, and married same-sex couples with one genetic parent traditionally have no issue obtaining pre-birth orders as a matter of course.Get more information about surrogacy in North Carolina. Alabama Alabama courts regularly recognize gestational surrogacy and establish parental rights for married couples and single Intended Parents regardless of genetic connection. More often than not, Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth declaratory judgment; in cases where that is not allowed (based on the county), Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth consent which becomes effective five days after delivery of the child. Ultimately, a post birth order may be necessary.Get more information about surrogacy in Alabama. Florida In Florida, gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Ch.742.15 FL Stat.) but only for married couples. However, surrogacy is still available to unmarried and single Intended Parents in Florida via court orders so long as one Intended Parent has a genetic connection. Although technically providing pre-birth orders, Florida is unique in that the pre-birth orders act more as interim orders for medical decisions and paternity. A post birth order must be obtained before a birth certificate containing the Intended Parents’ names will be issued. Florida also has a strict medical need requirement with the statute providing specific medical requirements such as the Intended Mother is not able to physically gestate a pregnancy to term.Get more information about surrogacy in Florida. New Jersey In 2018, the Gestational Carrier Agreement Act went into effect in New Jersey. The Act provided for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders for all types of Intended Parents in accordance with specific conditions. For example, the gestational carrier agreement must be in writing, all parties must have completed mental health evaluations, and independent legal representation must have been provided for the gestational carrier and Intended Parents. These requirements and protections make New Jersey a very surrogacy friendly state.Get more information about surrogacy in New Jersey. Texas By statute, Texas permits gestational surrogacy for married intended parents (Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 160.752, § 160.753, § 160.754). Under the law, the “gestational agreement” (aka GCA) must be validated by the court to be enforceable and confer parental rights. If the parties have a validated gestational carrier agreement, married Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth order. For Intended Parents who are not married, or those who are single, judges have the discretion to grant pre-birth orders. The Texas statute also contemplates the option of a post-birth order. Regardless of pre-birth or post-birth, there must be a genetic connection between the IPs and the child. For unmarried IPs, the non-genetic parent would need to complete a second parent adoption. One unique aspect of the Texas law is that the gestational carrier agreement needs to be validated to be enforceable.Get more information about surrogacy in Texas. Wisconsin Wisconsin’s Supreme Court ruled in the 2013 case of Paternity of F.T.R., Rosecky v. Schissel that surrogacy contracts are enforceable so long as they are not contrary to the best interests of the child. Typically, intended parents, regardless of marital status, can obtain parentage orders placing their names on the birth certificate so long as one parent is genetically related to the child. If neither intended parent is genetically related to the child, a parentage order may be granted but this will depend on the particular county and judge. Additionally, while parentage orders are often issued pre-birth, they are considered “interim” orders and require a subsequent, final order issued after the child’s birth to facilitate obtaining the birth certificate. Finally, in many cases a hearing is required where all parties may be expected to appear.Get more information about surrogacy in Wisconsin. Connecticut The Connecticut Parentage Act (CPA) provides a protected path to parentage for any intended parents pursuing gestational surrogacy. The CPA ensures that all Connecticut children – regardless of the circumstances of their birth or the marital status, gender, or sexual orientation of their parents – have equal access to the security of a legal parent-child relationship. Furthermore, Connecticut has a statute that requires Vital Records to comply with court orders in issuing a birth certificate naming the intended parents in a gestational surrogacy arrangement as the parents. Parentage orders are granted pre-birth, but an in-person healing with all parties (intended parents, gestational carrier, and gestational carrier spouse) tends to be required.Get more information about surrogacy in Connecticut. Indiana At first blush, Indiana may not seem like an ideal state for surrogacy as there is a statute that voids gestational carrier agreements. However, Indiana attorneys advise that said statute only applies to traditional surrogacy (where the surrogate is genetically related to the child), not gestational surrogacy. For added protection, gestational carrier agreements, where the gestational carrier resides in Indiana will likely be drafted using the state law where the Intended Parents or fertility clinic are located. Nonetheless, gestational surrogacy is widely practiced in Indiana and courts regularly grant parental rights via pre and post birth parentage orders to married Intended Parents who have some genetic connection to the child. Single intended parents may also obtain a pre-birth order if genetically related to the child, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Indiana. Washington, D.C.Our nation’s capital has an express surrogacy statute. DC statutes (DC Law §§ 16-401 – 16-412) provide that all Intended Parents can obtain pre-birth orders establishing their parentage regardless of genetic connection, marital status, sexual orientation or need for surrogacy. Said orders do not become effective until the moment of birth and either the intended parents or gestational carrier need to have resided in DC for at least one (1) year. If neither party meets the residency requirement, a post-birth order can be obtained.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington, DC. Alaska With no case law or statute prohibiting surrogacy, gestational surrogacy is permitted and practiced in Alaska. It is generally anticipated that courts will establish parentage pre-birth for intended parents regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic link to the expected child, but due to limited surrogacy matters in the area, it is best pursued by heterosexual parents who are married using embryos with their own genetics. A hearing is most likely required and all parties may be ordered to appear with most cases being filed and heard in Anchorage. Arizona Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Arizona pursuant to a 1994 appellate court decision (Soos v. Superior Court) and courts acknowledge certain parental rights via court order. Some courts will allow pre-birth orders, but many courts wait until after the birth of the child before entering a maternity order. An intended father who is the biological contributor can be listed on the birth certificate without any order through the use of a paternity affidavit in conjunction with a denial of paternity affidavit by the gestational carrier’s husband if the gestational carrier is married.Notably, surrogacy contracts are unenforceable and prohibited by statute (Arizona Revised Statute § 25-218). So how do the parties lay out the terms of their agreement? Most commonly, in lieu of Arizona law, the prevailing law of the gestational carrier agreement will be that of another state that has a connection to the surrogacy arrangement, not Arizona; this state is most commonly California. If there is a California connection to the surrogacy (e.g. one Party lives in CA or the Fertility Center is located in CA), the Parties can also bypass court proceedings in Arizona and instead obtain a court order from California. These court orders are routinely accepted by Arizona hospitals and Vital Records.Ultimately, there are several nuances with the Arizona process which is why it is critical to work with an experienced assisted reproduction technology attorney that is knowledgeable of the Arizona process. Arkansas Surrogacy is statutorily permitted in Arkansas (Code § 9-10-201) and there is flexibility in the establishment of parental rights with married intended parents able to obtain pre-birth orders. However, unmarried intended parents who create embryos with donor material will require a second parent adoption in their home state as only the biological parent can obtain a pre-birth order. Furthermore, pursuant to the statute, vital records shall initially list the gestational carrier on the birth certificate documents and then permanently amend such records to name the intended parents as the true legal parents; even when a pre-birth order has been issued. Delaware Delaware may be small but it sure is mighty when it comes to surrogacy. Gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Delaware Code 13, § 8-801 – § 8-810) for any and all IPs regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, and genetic relationship to the child. Parentage is established pre-birth and the statute explicitly provides that the gestational carrier is “not a parent of a child born as a result of a gestational carrier arrangement” so long as specified requirements are met in the arrangement. Hawaii There is no existing statute or case law in Hawaii that prohibits surrogacy so it is freely practiced so long as there is a genetic connection between the intended parents and the child. If the embryo was created with the assistance of an egg or sperm donor, the non-biological parent must complete a second parent adoption either in Hawaii or their home state, in order for the child’s birth certificate to show them both as the parents. For the non-biological parent, parentage can only be established post-birth. However, a hearing for the parentage order typically requires at least the gestational carrier and her spouse, if applicable, to attend in person. Idaho As of July 1, 2023, Idaho Gestational Agreements Act went into effect making Idaho a favorable state for surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection. Under the new law, the parties can file a petition to have their gestational carrier agreement validated pre-birth which in turn makes it enforceable under the statute. Upon finding that the gestational carrier agreement is valid, the court shall issue an order validating the agreement and declaring that the intended parents are/will be the parent(s) of any child born under the terms of the agreement. Then post-birth, the court will issue a validation order and an order of parentage confirming that the intended parents are the parent(s) of the child. Iowa Surrogacy is implicitly permitted in Iowa from a culmination of three legal premises: (1) Iowa Code provides that surrogacy agreements are exempt from Iowa’s law prohibiting the purchase or sale of an individual, (2) Iowa’s administrative code addresses the issuance of birth certificates for children born to a gestational carrier (Iowa Admin. Code r. 641-99.15(144)), and (3) the Iowa Supreme Court held in 2018 that gestational carrier agreements are enforceable and do not violate public policy or the constitutional rights of the gestational carrier or child (P.M. & C.M. v. T.B. & D.B). Furthermore, in the same case, the court stated that gestational carrier agreements “promote families by enabling infertile couples to raise their own children and help bring new life into this world through willing surrogate mothers.”As a result of this, parentage in Iowa is established in two (2) parts. First, parentage is only to be established before birth for the biological father, resulting in a birth certificate listing the biological father with gestational carrier. Then post-birth a second order is necessary to permanently change the child’s birth certificate to list the second parent. This second order is either a parentage order for the other genetic parent or an adoption for a non-genetic parent. Have you thought about becoming a surrogate?

    "content": "By Ashtin Gurevitz, a Two-Time Surrogate and ConceiveAbilities Surrogate Intake Manager Surrogacy has always been my calling. I knew I wanted to help someone have a family since I can remember. When I started dating my husband, who is also my high school sweetheart, I let him know becoming a surrogate was part of my plan. After completing our own beautiful family of three children, we decided the time was right. I knew my gift of surrogacy would change someone’s life, but I never dreamed it would change my life like it has. Matching with My Intended Parents Matching was the most important thing for me and my family. Matching with Brian and Scott, a loving gay couple from New York, was a dream come true. I always knew I wanted to work with a same-sex couple, and our connection was instant. I still get emotional about our first meeting. Throughout the pregnancy, Brian and Scott were amazing intended parents. We communicated regularly, and they visited us during important milestones. Their involvement made the journey feel like a shared experience, strengthening our bond that will last a lifetime. The Birth The day of delivery is the moment every surrogate dreams of. It’s hard to even put the excitement into words. I was surrounded by my husband, Jeff, who is my biggest cheerleader, and my best friend, Hannah, a birthing photographer who was capturing every moment. My focus was on Brian and Scott, who were there to witness the arrival of their son, Silas. When Silas was born, the emotions in the room were overwhelming. Seeing the happiness and love in Brian and Scott’s eyes was a moment I will cherish forever. I am so grateful to have these photos and video of this incredible moment. The Sibling Journey The journey did not end there. Soon after delivering Silas, I decided to do a sibling surrogacy journey with Brian and Scott, carrying their second child, Sloane, who completed their family. Becoming a surrogate has been a transformational experience for me. It has taught me the power of giving. Knowing that I played a part in building a family has left an indelible mark on my heart. Sharing Surrogacy Now I work at ConceiveAbilities to help other women fulfill their calling of becoming a surrogate. It is a unique opportunity to create a family, forge lifelong connections, and experience the magic of childbirth in a profound way. To anyone considering surrogacy, I encourage you to embrace the journey with an open heart and mind. There may be challenges, but the reward of witnessing a family come together is priceless. Surrogacy has changed my life in ways I could have never imagined, and I will forever be grateful for this incredible experience. Learn more about becoming a surrogate.

    "content": "When talking about surrogacy laws in New York, it is impossible to not mention Andy Cohen and his own journey with surrogacy. Cohen’s daughter, Lucy, was one of the very first babies born in NYC under the new surrogacy laws. Cohen was frustrated by the laws prohibiting gestational surrogacy in his home state, so took matters into his own hands to advocate for surrogacy’s legalization. “I wanted my surrogate to have the baby in New York”, Cohen states, as his motivation to push this law through and get surrogacy legal in New York. ConceiveAbilities is proud to be among the first surrogacy agencies to be licensed in New York.

    "content": "U.S. Surrogacy Laws By State By Fran Caruso, Esq. ConceiveAbilities is your trusted resource for all things surrogacy including guidance through the legal process. Surrogacy laws vary from state to state and even sometimes county to county. That is why, in addition to our own internal team of expert attorneys, ConceiveAbilities partners with local, state specific attorneys who specialize in reproductive law. Surrogacy laws are ever-changing, but we are here to ensure you feel informed, comfortable, and assured as you proceed forward with the legal process. Below is a brief overview of the current laws impacting surrogacy in relevant states. We are always here to provide additional information and answer your questions so that you can feel confident from the legal perspective as you embark on a surrogacy journey with ConceiveAbilities. Illinois Illinois is ConceiveAbilities’ home base! In Illinois, gestational surrogacy is permitted via statute and allows intended parents(s) to be declared the legal parent(s) upon birth of the child as long as one intended parent is a genetic contributor to the child. As such, legal parentage is determined upon birth and intended parents can obtain a birth certificate from vital statistics directly. If the statute’s requirements are not met, or if a court order is needed for other reasons, then parentage may be determined via a post-birth order. Finally, if both egg donor and sperm donor are used, parental rights would be obtained via an adoption proceeding.Get more information about surrogacy in Illinois. New York As of February 15, 2021, compensated gestational surrogacy was made legal in New York via its new statute: the Child Parent Security Act (CPSA). The CPSA includes the Surrogate’s Bill of Rights–the first of its kind in the industry–as well as many requirements for the gestational carrier agreements. You can learn more about the CPSA and its impact on the surrogacy industry here.Notably, ConceiveAbilities was one of the first surrogacy agencies to be licensed by the New York Department of Health. To comply with the CPSA, ConceiveAbilities ensures that its intended parents and gestational carriers have experienced, well-versed reproductive attorneys who are knowledgeable of the CPSA. Under the CPSA, New York courts will grant pre-birth orders for all intended parents regardless of genetic contributors, marital status, or sexual orientation who are parties to a compensated surrogacy arrangement; and the order will go into effect at the time of the birth.Get more information about surrogacy in New York. Colorado Gestational surrogacy is legal in Colorado via the Colorado Surrogacy Agreement Act. The law protects both the intended parents and the gestational carrier who have entered into gestational carrier agreements consistent with the law. ConceiveAbilities ensures that during the drafting of the gestational carrier agreement all parties are represented by attorneys licensed in Colorado as is required by the law. Intended parents can proceed with a gestational carrier in Colorado regardless of their marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or need for surrogacy. Parentage can be determined via a pre-birth order from the juvenile court and said order will vest the intended parents with all parental rights and duties to the child immediately upon birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Colorado. California California is often thought of as the “friendliest” state for surrogacy and for good reason—California was the first state to enact a statute that makes surrogacy available to all! And while there are other states that are similarly as supportive and legally secure, California remains one of the most sought after states for surrogacy. Intended Parents, regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy, can obtain a pre-birth order. This is true so long as any portion of the surrogacy occurred in California–specifically: (1) the county where the child is anticipated to be born, (2) the county where the intended parent(s) reside, (3) the county where the gestational carrier resides, (4) the county where the assisted reproduction agreement for gestational carrier is executed, or (5) the county where medical procedures pursuant to the GCA (i.e. embryo transfers) are to be performed. The pre-birth order becomes effective at the moment of birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Southern California and Northern California Oregon Although there are no specific surrogacy laws in Oregon, there are laws that contemplate the relationship between the intended parent(s) and a child conceived via assisted reproductive technology. Furthermore, there are no specific statutes or case law that prohibit surrogacy. Surrogacy is safely practiced in Oregon and is available to any and all types of intended parents who will legally be declared the parents of the child. Most judges issue pre-birth orders if there is a genetic connection between the intended parent(s) and child and in some cases even when there is not a genetic connection. Post-birth orders are also available if needed.Get more information about surrogacy in Oregon. Washington Rounding out the surrogacy friendly states of the west coast is Washington. As of January 1, 2019, Washington enacted a parentage statute that provides for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders. Pre-birth orders are granted regardless of the intended parent(s) marital status, sexual preference, genetic connection, or medical need for surrogacy. Pre-birth orders go into effect upon the birth of the child. Washington law defines who can be a “gestational surrogate” and provides specific details as to what terms need to be included in the gestational carrier for it to be enforceable. Specifically, a gestational carrier may not have completed more than two (2) surrogacies.Therefore, for all parties’ protection, it is critical that intended parents and gestational carriers work with experienced surrogacy professionals, like those at ConceiveAbilities, who are well versed in the specific requirements in Washington.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington. Minnesota Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Minnesota as no statute or published case law prohibits surrogacy. Surrogacy is available to Intended Parents regardless of marital status or genetic connection. Although many courts in several counties will grant pre-birth declaratory judgments, the more likely course of action is that parentage will be determined post-birth, especially if donor material was used. The relevant paperwork can be filed pre-birth, but it will not be granted until after birth. Additionally, a hearing is oftentimes required by the presiding judge meaning that all parties should anticipate remaining in Minnesota until the necessary legal work is completed. Arguably the most notable aspect of surrogacy in Minnesota is that if a judge will not sign a pre-birth declaratory judgment, a non-genetic parent will need to obtain a second parent adoption post-birth to confer parental rights. While the optics of this is not ideal, as it is the intended parents’ child, it is a critical step to ensure that all intended parents have equal legal rights to their child. The second parent adoption is typically completed quickly after birth in conjunction with the other post-birth legal proceedings in order to ensure both parents are named on the birth certificate.Get more information about surrogacy in Minnesota. Massachusetts Gestational surrogacy is supported in Massachusetts by three notable cases decided by the Commonwealth’s superior Court – Hodas v. Morin (2004); Culliton v. Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr. (2002); and R.R. v. M.H. (1998). Married and unmarried couples and single individuals, regardless of sexual orientation and/or genetic connection, may obtain a pre-birth order. A hearing is typically not required but is ultimately up to the judge’s discretion.Get more information about surrogacy in Massachusetts. Nevada Not to be outdone by its neighboring state of California, Nevada also has a surrogacy statute that permits gestational surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, genetic connection, or medical need. Pre-birth and post-birth orders are available. The Nevada statute specifically provides that parties may enter into gestational carrier agreements which contemplate payment of consideration for surrogacy services. The statute also requires that the gestational carrier agreement expressly state that the gestational carrier and her legal spouse/partner relinquish all rights and duties to the child conceived through assisted reproduction and that it is the intended parent(s) who are the parents of any resulting child. While the gestational carrier agreement would already state this regardless of the prevailing state law, Nevada has appropriately made this a statutory requirement for any gestational carrier agreement. Way to go Nevada!Get more information about surrogacy in Nevada. Pennsylvania Although there is no surrogacy statute in Pennsylvania, gestational surrogacy is still permitted and practiced. Pennsylvania declared in a 2006 case that a surrogacy contract is not contrary to public policy and that the gestational carrier is not the “legal mother.” Furthermore, in 2015, the Superior Court confirmed the enforceability of gestational carrier agreements as well as intended parents legal parentage to the child regardless of any genetic connection. Pre-birth orders are available, although this sometimes varies based on the specific county and judge, particularly if donor material is used. However, thanks to these court decisions, parties can safely proceed with gestational surrogacy in Pennsylvania.Get more information about surrogacy in Pennsylvania. Maryland Maryland has been a favorable state for gestational surrogacy since 2003. Similar to other states, parties are able to safely practice gestational surrogacy thanks to a favorable court decision (as compared to an explicit statute). Maryland’s highest court implicitly approved gestational surrogacy by determining that a gestational carrier is not required to be listed as the “mother” on the birth certificate of the child thereby leading to having the intended parents exclusively listed. Regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection, Intended Parents are able to establish their parental rights pre-birth.Get more information about surrogacy in Maryland. Georgia Despite no statutory or case law directly addressing surrogacy contracts in Georgia, it is a favorable state for gestational surrogacy. Courts regularly establish parental rights for Intended Parents through a pre-birth declaratory judgment regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic connection (although there may be additional paperwork required). The court process is typically very seamless – everything is usually handled directly between attorneys and usually no in-person hearing is required, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Georgia. Virginia Many are surprised to learn that surrogacy is authorized by statute in Virginia. Virginia’s “Status of Children of Assisted Conception” is unique because although it contemplates court approval process, this can only be done prior to embryo transfer and is not a pre-birth parentage order. It is instead a lengthy court process more akin to an adoption proceeding–home studies for all parties, the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the unborn child, and a full trial-like court hearing. Therefore, almost all Intended Parents bypass this and opt to establish their parental rights post-birth either through the administrative process contemplated in the statute or an order of parentage from the court. One other unique note for Virginia, the gestational carrier cannot sign any of the documents until 72 hours after the child is born. Finally, Virginia has a marital requirement for couples pursuing gestational surrogacy, but there need not be any genetic connection so long as ownership of the embryo can be proven. Ohio As of 2007, the Ohio Supreme Court has confirmed that gestational surrogacy is not against public policy and therefore gestational surrogacy is readily practiced in Ohio. While pre-birth orders are granted, they are discretionary meaning they are somewhat variable depending on the county. However, most counties will issue a pre-birth order for married Intended Parents, unmarried heterosexual couples, or singles regardless of sexual orientation or genetics. If not possible, Intended Parents can obtain a post-birth order to secure their parental rights.Get more information about surrogacy in Ohio. North Carolina Gestational surrogacy is practiced in North Carolina as there is no prohibition of it by either case law or statute. While most intended parents are able to obtain a pre-birth parentage, in some rare occasions parentage may be determined post-birth. The biggest factor is the intended parents’ marital status and genetic connection to the child. One specificity as to North Carolina gestational surrogacy is that when a known donor is used, the donor will also to be a party to the parentage legal proceedings. Nevertheless, single genetic parents, married and unmarried heterosexual couples with at least one genetic parent, and married same-sex couples with one genetic parent traditionally have no issue obtaining pre-birth orders as a matter of course.Get more information about surrogacy in North Carolina. Alabama Alabama courts regularly recognize gestational surrogacy and establish parental rights for married couples and single Intended Parents regardless of genetic connection. More often than not, Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth declaratory judgment; in cases where that is not allowed (based on the county), Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth consent which becomes effective five days after delivery of the child. Ultimately, a post birth order may be necessary.Get more information about surrogacy in Alabama. Florida In Florida, gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Ch.742.15 FL Stat.) but only for married couples. However, surrogacy is still available to unmarried and single Intended Parents in Florida via court orders so long as one Intended Parent has a genetic connection. Although technically providing pre-birth orders, Florida is unique in that the pre-birth orders act more as interim orders for medical decisions and paternity. A post birth order must be obtained before a birth certificate containing the Intended Parents’ names will be issued. Florida also has a strict medical need requirement with the statute providing specific medical requirements such as the Intended Mother is not able to physically gestate a pregnancy to term.Get more information about surrogacy in Florida. New Jersey In 2018, the Gestational Carrier Agreement Act went into effect in New Jersey. The Act provided for enforceable gestational carrier agreements and pre-birth orders for all types of Intended Parents in accordance with specific conditions. For example, the gestational carrier agreement must be in writing, all parties must have completed mental health evaluations, and independent legal representation must have been provided for the gestational carrier and Intended Parents. These requirements and protections make New Jersey a very surrogacy friendly state.Get more information about surrogacy in New Jersey. Texas By statute, Texas permits gestational surrogacy for married intended parents (Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 160.752, § 160.753, § 160.754). Under the law, the “gestational agreement” (aka GCA) must be validated by the court to be enforceable and confer parental rights. If the parties have a validated gestational carrier agreement, married Intended Parents may obtain a pre-birth order. For Intended Parents who are not married, or those who are single, judges have the discretion to grant pre-birth orders. The Texas statute also contemplates the option of a post-birth order. Regardless of pre-birth or post-birth, there must be a genetic connection between the IPs and the child. For unmarried IPs, the non-genetic parent would need to complete a second parent adoption. One unique aspect of the Texas law is that the gestational carrier agreement needs to be validated to be enforceable.Get more information about surrogacy in Texas. Wisconsin Wisconsin’s Supreme Court ruled in the 2013 case of Paternity of F.T.R., Rosecky v. Schissel that surrogacy contracts are enforceable so long as they are not contrary to the best interests of the child. Typically, intended parents, regardless of marital status, can obtain parentage orders placing their names on the birth certificate so long as one parent is genetically related to the child. If neither intended parent is genetically related to the child, a parentage order may be granted but this will depend on the particular county and judge. Additionally, while parentage orders are often issued pre-birth, they are considered “interim” orders and require a subsequent, final order issued after the child’s birth to facilitate obtaining the birth certificate. Finally, in many cases a hearing is required where all parties may be expected to appear.Get more information about surrogacy in Wisconsin. Connecticut The Connecticut Parentage Act (CPA) provides a protected path to parentage for any intended parents pursuing gestational surrogacy. The CPA ensures that all Connecticut children – regardless of the circumstances of their birth or the marital status, gender, or sexual orientation of their parents – have equal access to the security of a legal parent-child relationship. Furthermore, Connecticut has a statute that requires Vital Records to comply with court orders in issuing a birth certificate naming the intended parents in a gestational surrogacy arrangement as the parents. Parentage orders are granted pre-birth, but an in-person healing with all parties (intended parents, gestational carrier, and gestational carrier spouse) tends to be required.Get more information about surrogacy in Connecticut. Indiana At first blush, Indiana may not seem like an ideal state for surrogacy as there is a statute that voids gestational carrier agreements. However, Indiana attorneys advise that said statute only applies to traditional surrogacy (where the surrogate is genetically related to the child), not gestational surrogacy. For added protection, gestational carrier agreements, where the gestational carrier resides in Indiana will likely be drafted using the state law where the Intended Parents or fertility clinic are located. Nonetheless, gestational surrogacy is widely practiced in Indiana and courts regularly grant parental rights via pre and post birth parentage orders to married Intended Parents who have some genetic connection to the child. Single intended parents may also obtain a pre-birth order if genetically related to the child, but this can vary by judge.Get more information about surrogacy in Indiana. Washington, D.C.Our nation’s capital has an express surrogacy statute. DC statutes (DC Law §§ 16-401 – 16-412) provide that all Intended Parents can obtain pre-birth orders establishing their parentage regardless of genetic connection, marital status, sexual orientation or need for surrogacy. Said orders do not become effective until the moment of birth and either the intended parents or gestational carrier need to have resided in DC for at least one (1) year. If neither party meets the residency requirement, a post-birth order can be obtained.Get more information about surrogacy in Washington, DC. Alaska With no case law or statute prohibiting surrogacy, gestational surrogacy is permitted and practiced in Alaska. It is generally anticipated that courts will establish parentage pre-birth for intended parents regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, or genetic link to the expected child, but due to limited surrogacy matters in the area, it is best pursued by heterosexual parents who are married using embryos with their own genetics. A hearing is most likely required and all parties may be ordered to appear with most cases being filed and heard in Anchorage. Arizona Gestational surrogacy is practiced in Arizona pursuant to a 1994 appellate court decision (Soos v. Superior Court) and courts acknowledge certain parental rights via court order. Some courts will allow pre-birth orders, but many courts wait until after the birth of the child before entering a maternity order. An intended father who is the biological contributor can be listed on the birth certificate without any order through the use of a paternity affidavit in conjunction with a denial of paternity affidavit by the gestational carrier’s husband if the gestational carrier is married.Notably, surrogacy contracts are unenforceable and prohibited by statute (Arizona Revised Statute § 25-218). So how do the parties lay out the terms of their agreement? Most commonly, in lieu of Arizona law, the prevailing law of the gestational carrier agreement will be that of another state that has a connection to the surrogacy arrangement, not Arizona; this state is most commonly California. If there is a California connection to the surrogacy (e.g. one Party lives in CA or the Fertility Center is located in CA), the Parties can also bypass court proceedings in Arizona and instead obtain a court order from California. These court orders are routinely accepted by Arizona hospitals and Vital Records.Ultimately, there are several nuances with the Arizona process which is why it is critical to work with an experienced assisted reproduction technology attorney that is knowledgeable of the Arizona process. Arkansas Surrogacy is statutorily permitted in Arkansas (Code § 9-10-201) and there is flexibility in the establishment of parental rights with married intended parents able to obtain pre-birth orders. However, unmarried intended parents who create embryos with donor material will require a second parent adoption in their home state as only the biological parent can obtain a pre-birth order. Furthermore, pursuant to the statute, vital records shall initially list the gestational carrier on the birth certificate documents and then permanently amend such records to name the intended parents as the true legal parents; even when a pre-birth order has been issued. Delaware Delaware may be small but it sure is mighty when it comes to surrogacy. Gestational surrogacy is permitted by statute (Delaware Code 13, § 8-801 – § 8-810) for any and all IPs regardless of sexual orientation, marital status, and genetic relationship to the child. Parentage is established pre-birth and the statute explicitly provides that the gestational carrier is “not a parent of a child born as a result of a gestational carrier arrangement” so long as specified requirements are met in the arrangement. Hawaii There is no existing statute or case law in Hawaii that prohibits surrogacy so it is freely practiced so long as there is a genetic connection between the intended parents and the child. If the embryo was created with the assistance of an egg or sperm donor, the non-biological parent must complete a second parent adoption either in Hawaii or their home state, in order for the child’s birth certificate to show them both as the parents. For the non-biological parent, parentage can only be established post-birth. However, a hearing for the parentage order typically requires at least the gestational carrier and her spouse, if applicable, to attend in person. Idaho As of July 1, 2023, Idaho Gestational Agreements Act went into effect making Idaho a favorable state for surrogacy for all intended parents regardless of marital status, sexual orientation, or genetic connection. Under the new law, the parties can file a petition to have their gestational carrier agreement validated pre-birth which in turn makes it enforceable under the statute. Upon finding that the gestational carrier agreement is valid, the court shall issue an order validating the agreement and declaring that the intended parents are/will be the parent(s) of any child born under the terms of the agreement. Then post-birth, the court will issue a validation order and an order of parentage confirming that the intended parents are the parent(s) of the child. Iowa Surrogacy is implicitly permitted in Iowa from a culmination of three legal premises: (1) Iowa Code provides that surrogacy agreements are exempt from Iowa’s law prohibiting the purchase or sale of an individual, (2) Iowa’s administrative code addresses the issuance of birth certificates for children born to a gestational carrier (Iowa Admin. Code r. 641-99.15(144)), and (3) the Iowa Supreme Court held in 2018 that gestational carrier agreements are enforceable and do not violate public policy or the constitutional rights of the gestational carrier or child (P.M. & C.M. v. T.B. & D.B). Furthermore, in the same case, the court stated that gestational carrier agreements “promote families by enabling infertile couples to raise their own children and help bring new life into this world through willing surrogate mothers.”As a result of this, parentage in Iowa is established in two (2) parts. First, parentage is only to be established before birth for the biological father, resulting in a birth certificate listing the biological father with gestational carrier. Then post-birth a second order is necessary to permanently change the child’s birth certificate to list the second parent. This second order is either a parentage order for the other genetic parent or an adoption for a non-genetic parent. Have you thought about becoming a surrogate?

Based on the wants and needs of each party, identifying the right match for the right set of personalities and needs is essential for success.

Screening Our screenings aren’t just a box to tick off, they’re a key stage in our process. We work very hard to ensure surrogates can pass the respective fertility clinic’s criteria; in fact, 95% of our surrogates receive fertility clinic clearance. For surrogates and intended parents alike, the rigor of our screening process helps ensure that your investment of time and emotion is honored and secured. Equally important, matching at ConceiveAbilities is based on understanding the fundamental motivations and context behind the surrogacy arrangement. Who are the people involved? What is their background and their life experiences? What is life at home like? What is their vision for the surrogacy experience? These questions are vital to getting to know each surrogate and each intended parent, so that matches will be compatible. Local Matching Matters™ We know that geographic proximity between intended parents, surrogates and fertility clinics throughout your surrogacy journey might be important to you – for convenience, relationship building and peace of mind. We honor that desire, and because of our reach and popularity in communities across the country, we can address that need. You may find, in your matching process, that factors other than geographic proximity become more important to you. We see great success in both local and long distance surrogacy journeys.

    "content": "By Fran Caruso, Esq. When you embark on a surrogacy journey, you’ll learn all kinds of new medical and legal terminology. Something that you will hear referenced often, from the attorney’s office to the hospital, is the legal parentage process and accompanying legal documents. This process is the critical step whereby parentage is determined – though at what point and in what manner this occurs can vary by state. Depending on where your child is born, the legal parentage process will be completed either pre- or post-birth. What does pre-birth mean? The pre-birth process means that the relevant state law provides an avenue for the parties to present an order to a judge for entry prior to the child being born that establishes the intended parent(s) as the legal parents of the child. It will also likely direct the hospital to release the child to the intended parents after discharge and order the state’s Office of Vital Records to name the intended parents on the child’s birth certificate.What does post-birth mean?The post-birth process is overall procedurally the same as the pre-birth, but it occurs after the child is born. Often this is because the relevant state law contemplates the existence of a live child before anything can be filed or entered. But the ultimate result is the same – a birth certificate with the intended parents’ names and secure legal parentage of the child in favor of the intended parents. What are the legal risks? A common concern amongst intended parents when discussing pre-versus post-birth is whether there is a greater legal risk associated with the post-birth process; i.e., can the gestational carrier decide to keep the baby? In a word, no. ConceiveAbilities will only match intended parents and gestational carriers in a state that supports their respective rights. As the pregnant person, the gestational carrier will have standing to object to the process, whether in a pre- OR a post-birth state. But in either case and what really matters, is that such an objection would be a losing argument. The gestational carrier will have no genetic relationship to the child, there will be a gestational carrier agreement outlining the parties’ rights and responsibilities, and affidavits from doctors and lawyers proving that the intended parents are entitled to legal parentage. Additionally, there will be other documents in place, such as a HIPAA release and power of attorney, ensuring that the intended parents may make all medical decisions for the child and that the child is discharged into their care.On the flip side, a common concern amongst gestational carriers is what happens if the intended parents do not take the baby; do I become responsible? Again, the answer is no. The gestational carrier agreement protects the gestational carrier from any legal or medical responsibility for the child. We encourage you to not focus on whether the legal parentage will occur pre- versus post-birth because, in either circumstance, the intended parents’ legal rights will be secured, and their names will end up on the child’s birth certificate; it is truly a question of when it procedurally occurs. A Final Note on Legal Parentage Every state, whether pre-birth, post-birth, or some amalgamation of the two, has its own unique process and requirements. That is why it is critical to work with an experienced Assisted Reproductive Technology lawyer and agency; you do not want to be some one’s first when it comes to securing parental rights.

    "content": "By Fran Caruso, Esq. A surrogacy contract (also known as a Gestational Carrier Agreement or GCA) is arguably one of the most important documents of the surrogacy journey. Below is a brief overview of the process of drafting the GCA as well as the different terms, rights, and responsibilities that will be contemplated by all parties in the GCA. Drafting the Surrogacy Contract The intended parents and the gestational carrier should each have their own separate independent attorney’s who specialize in reproductive law. Having a separate attorney represent each party ensures a fair and equal representation of both the parties interests. The GCA is drafted by the intended parents’ attorney and includes all of the substantive terms discussed during the matching process. The intended parents will review the agreement with their attorney and then it will be sent to the gestational carrier and her attorney for review. Through their respective attorney’s, the parties will then negotiate the terms of the GCA until all parties have agreed. All parties should expect that there will be some back and forth negotiation of the GCA; this is a good thing and ensures that both parties had adequate representation and understand their rights and responsibilities. Once the terms are agreed to, all parties will execute the GCA and move onto the phase of the journey. Understanding the Contract Topics The GCA exists to protect all parties and ensure everyone understands their rights and responsibilities. Below are some of the terms that will be contemplated in the GCA. Recitals & General Provisions: These sections outline the relevant information about all parties as well as the intent of everyone entering into this agreement. This is essentially a background section that provides critical information as to who, what, where, when, and why. You will also find a numerous defined terms located in this section that provide clarification for the remainder of the GCA. Travel: Provides the details around when and where the gestational carrier can travel during the journey. There will be certain restrictions on travel, both domestic and international, to ensure that the child is born in a surrogacy friendly state. Confidentiality: This section will detail what information may or may not be disclosed regarding the intended parents, gestational carrier, terms of the GCA, and resulting pregnancy. This will also contemplate any future contact between the parties and disclosure to the child that they were born via surrogacy. Medical Considerations: These sections contain some of the most lengthy and sensitive terms including medical screening, testing, undergoing procedures, taking medications, embryo transfer, gestational carrier’s limitations while pregnant, vaccinations, termination or selective reduction, medical emergencies, and facts surrounding delivery of the child. Finances: This will not only detail any financial compensation/reimbursements the gestational carrier is entitled to, but will also detail financial responsibilities for things like insurance, lost wages, bedrest, etc. For a more in-depth breakdown of the cost of surrogacy, read more here. Parentage: The GCA will cite the specific state’s legal authority. It will also detail the process for obtaining the necessary parentage documents to declare the intended parents as the legal parents of the child. It will also contemplate the specific details as to custody and care of the child immediately following birth. Breach & Termination of Agreement: While all parties enter into the GCA hoping and anticipating that there will be no problems, it is essential that the worst-case scenarios are acknowledged and anticipated. Assumption of Risk: Surrogacy and pregnancy are complex matters. All parties need to understand not only their protections, but also the potential risks. “Boiler Plate” Terms: The final part of the GCA will include numerous terms, which are called “boiler plate” terms as they can be found in most contracts, not just surrogacy contracts. These will include things like identification of the respective attorneys, notice requirements, modification procedures, signature specifics, etc. Even though the GCA may not necessarily be the most exciting aspect of the surrogacy, it is extremely important and is critical to confirming all parties are on the same page at the outset of the journey. Take your time in reviewing the GCA and be sure to ask your attorney any and all questions. Learn more about growing your family with surrogacy.

Surrogacy Legal Concepts: Frequently Asked Questions It is important to know the legal landscape for surrogacy so you feel confident and can be a full participant in the process. Here are the answers to some of your common questions:: What is a Gestational Carrier Agreement (“GCA”)? The legal contract between the surrogate and her intended parents, known as the Gestational Carrier Agreement (“GCA”), sits at the heart of your match with intended parents. It’s equally crucial for both surrogate and intended parent alike, so that each parties’ rights and responsibilities to one another are clearly outlined. What is the Legal Gold Standard for Surrogate Rights? Every state has different surrogacy laws and legal precedents. New York recently enacted the Gestational Surrogates’ Bill of Rights, the gold standard of surrogate rights. It ensures gestational surrogates are aware of their rights as they relate to their health and welfare, right to independent legal counsel, health insurance and medical costs, life insurance and contract termination protections. Can intended parents choose not to take the baby? No. The gestational carrier agreement protects the surrogate from any kind of legal or medical responsibility for the child. That said, the concern that the surrogate may become attached to the baby is a common misconception about surrogacy. Listen to our Busting Surrogacy Myths with Dr. Heather Carlson to learn more about surrogacy facts. How is Legal Parentage Established during Surrogacy? A court order ensures that the parentage is properly established. The particulars of how and when the court order occurs vary by state; at ConceiveAbilities, our legal experts guide these activities. A pre-birth order is a court order that establishes the intended parent(s) as the legal parents of the baby. What is the Legal Difference in Types of Surrogacy? First, it’s important to address the different types of surrogacy. While it’s rarely practiced today – and in many states, it’s illegal – traditional (genetic) surrogacy still exists. This means that the surrogate’s own egg is used, making her the child’s genetic mother. It can invite many potential legal and other complications, which is why few intended parents choose this route and is not a type of surrogacy offered by ConceiveAbilities. In the more common gestational surrogacy arrangement, and the arrangement that ConceiveAbilities work with exclusively, the surrogate undergoes In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and carries a child that is genetically related to the intended parents or donor(s). With a proper legal contract in place to protect all parties, gestational surrogacy arrangements are the safest route. Surrogacy laws by state Surrogacy laws vary by state. First and foremost, the surrogate must reside in a state where surrogacy is permitted. In states where surrogacy is specifically prohibited, there may be a risk of criminal and civil penalties, among other risks. Working with a reputable agency like ConceiveAbilities and an attorney who is well versed in surrogacy law is the only way to mitigate these risks; having surrogacy contracts explained protects both the intended parents’ and the surrogate’s rights. Ultimately, recognizing a surrogate’s rights are imperative to a smooth surrogacy journey. We’re here to inform and support you every step of the way.

Paris credits her friend Kim Kardashian to helping her understand surrogacy. ConceiveAbilities Director of Legal Services, Gina-Marie Madow, told DailyMail.com about the influence celebrity has on surrogacy in Everything You Need to Know About Celebrity Surrogacy. She shared that celebrities using surrogacy and sharing their stories had helped normalize it and inspire more women to get involved in the process. “We recently hired [research firm] Accelerant Research to better understand surrogacy. Our research shows almost half of the people surveyed were first exposed to surrogacy through a TV show, or a celebrity surrogacy story like Paris Hilton’s. It also shows that women who have read about or watched celebrity surrogacy journeys are inspired to learn more about becoming a surrogate. Celebrities sharing their surrogacy journeys also normalize the surrogacy process, normalizing the fertility treatment for hopeful parents to grow their families via a surrogate.” On Tuesday, Hilton shared a statement with People about their child, which read: “It’s always been my dream to be a mother and I’m so happy that Carter and I found each other. We are so excited to start our family together and our hearts are exploding with love for our baby boy.” Congratulations, Paris and Carter on your dream come true!

    "content": "As a top fertility doctor at KindBody, Dr. Angie Beltsos has helped thousands of families from all over the world have children using IVF and surrogacy. Sadly, when her daughter Elena didn’t survive, Dr. Beltsos became the patient. She, her husband and her three children decided as a family to partner with a surrogate to complete their own family. This is her surrogacy journey. ConceiveAbilities: How did you choose surrogacy to build your family after suffering a loss? Dr. Angie Beltsos: When some women decide that they’re going to partner with a surrogate, it’s a very sad, and traumatic decision for them to have to make. They might feel guilty or feel like their body has rejected them; some women go through some of this internal turmoil. It’s hard to accept that her baby is going to grow in this other woman. So I think you have to sort of find your way with that, work through some of those feelings and identify what the ideal situation is in picking a surrogate when you’re having some of that internal conflict. Others, such as gay men are very excited because they never thought they’d get to be parents. Now, with opportunities like surrogacy, they can have a family! There’s a lot of different directions and emotions that lead to picking a surrogate. When my husband and I picked our surrogate, it was us surrendering to the process, embracing it and really having fun. Because of my personal experience, I tell people to find the person that you’re going to do this journey with and celebrate what you’re doing together. Watch Dr. Beltsos video share more about her surrogacy journey. ConceiveAbilities: How was your surrogacy journey surprising to your surrogate? Dr. Angie Beltsos: Our surrogate, Jodi and her husband thought they were going to do this altruistic, incredible thing for a couple that does not have children. When they met us, however, we already had three children. We had a fourth child, Elena, who unfortunately didn’t survive. She was born early and we lost her. So Jodi asked us, “What do your kids think of you doing this?” and learned how much our whole family wanted this baby. Most surrogates match with intended parents but, in our story, Jodi matched with our intended family, all of us. ConceiveAbilities: Thinking about this gift Jodi has given your family; how does it make you feel? Dr. Angie Beltsos: We absolutely love Jodi. When our baby was born, her family was in the room afterwards with us holding the baby, loving her. She brought a photographer, so we could take those first day pictures. Our surrogate was just recovering from giving us this most precious gift, so we wanted to celebrate her first day of life together. Jodi’s husband, who is this tough guy in the Army, cried when it was time for us to leave. The people in your life that take care of your child, whether the child is an embryo or toddler, are very invested in the success and the health of the child. It’s magical and it’s important. So don’t be afraid of it, embrace it. You’ll find that that journey becomes even more precious, even many years later. ConceiveAbilities: How has your personal experience through your surrogacy journey helped you help people throughout their own journeys? Dr. Angie Beltsos: You don’t have to have gone through something to be compassionate. There are really incredible doctors that may not have that personal story to add. Empathy, however, when you yourself have gone through it goes a long way. Losing a pregnancy through miscarriage and going through my own surrogate journey provides me a very unique vantage point for my patients. Although I have been trained medically to help care for you, I have also been trained personally. My war wounds and successes have helped me be a better doctor!

    "content": "Sam Mathews felt a calling to become a surrogate and give the gift of family. Sharing every step of their surrogacy journey (the good and the challenging), she and her husband Dan quickly became surrogacy influencers amassing a social following of nearing a million curious people wanting to learn more about the surrogacy process. Sam successfully completed her surrogacy journey in late summer 2022 giving birth to a family’s little boy and continues to share her experience on @wearedanandsam. Sam says using her voice to share the facts about surrogacy and inspire other women to become surrogates is a gift she intends to keep giving. Listen to Nazca Fontes, our CEO and Founder, interview Sam about her experiences as a surrogate, and as a surrogate influencer in the latest edition of All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast. NF: When did you first become interested in the idea of becoming a surrogate? After our youngest daughter Ember, we felt our family was complete. We had a boy and a girl, but I still desired to be pregnant. One day my friend asked me if we were done with our family; I told her yes, but I would love to be pregnant again and asked her, “Is that a weird feeling?” She said “No, you need to become a surrogate.” I had actually thought about it and hadn’t looked into it, so I took this as a sign. It is definitely a calling. I thought if my body is able to carry a pregnancy, then why not help someone else? We get one life on this earth and I want to use it for good. Feeling led to do something and following through with it is such a great feeling. NF: Your husband, Dan, also does content with you. How did you talk to him about your desire to be a surrogate? When I brought it up back in 2018, I reminded him that we were done with our family and that I really liked pregnancy and labor. He said “Yes, I know,” and I asked him his thoughts on me being a surrogate. His first response was, “We’re not giving our baby away.” I told him that was a surrogacy myth and I explained the differences between traditional and gestational surrogacy and that it is not our baby. He did some more research and after about a week of talking about it and praying about it, he was on board! I needed to make sure he understood what he was getting into, because I knew that I would need his support in not only labor, but also throughout the journey. Plus, it’s an emotional journey and I needed his strength for that. Whether one has a spouse or partner, a friend or sibling, having support is so important. NF: How did you decide you wanted to share your journey on TikTok? We were already sharing our life on social media. We were renovating RVs at the time and sharing that life along with motherhood so it just made sense to continue sharing it. We’re very big on sharing the ups and downs, because life isn’t always peaches and cream. I thought how great it would be for us to share our surrogacy journey from matching to delivery and just share the good and the bad, you know, the shots, the appointments, the feelings, the emotions, the excitement, the joy to share it all in hopes that it would be encouraging to someone else. NF: What were some of your most memorable moments during your surrogacy journey? Before this, I would never post myself in my underwear online and I spent my surrogacy journey posting milestones in my Calvin Kleins. I said I would never give myself a shot because I would not be able to handle it. And oh my gosh, I had to do it one night when Dan was away at an event. I went live on TikTok and 800 people were watching me as I did it. I almost passed out, but I did it. I talked about condoms online and how awkward it is buying them and pregnancy tests at the same time while everyone in the store stares at you. Like what are people thinking? In real life, it is always funny when people congratulate you on your pregnancy and you’re like, oh actually it’s not mine. And then they look at my husband and he is like, it’s not mine either and then everyone is just confused! NF: We love busting surrogacy myths. What were surrogacy misconceptions you heard? A lot of people asked, “How can you give a baby away?” And then we explained the baby was not genetically related to me. People were curious on how transfer worked and to be honest, when we first pursued surrogacy, I didn’t know. And so explaining how IVF works is helpful; others need to know that the pregnancy occurs through a catheter in a clinic, overseen by a doctor, to understand the surrogacy process. People were also curious on how the transition would go with handing the baby over. Would I be sad about not bringing home a baby for ourselves (no, it’s not our baby) or if the husband would be in the delivery room (yes he was). There are so many different questions about surrogacy because it’s not widely talked about. NF: What was the moment of delivery like as a surrogate? That moment when they held their baby and seeing their eyes filled with so much joy and gratitude and thankfulness was such a memorable experience. I turned to my husband and said, “We did it. WE did it!” And I’m so thankful we got it on camera to document our journey coming to completion. In that moment, we did what we set out to do, what we vowed to do, what we agreed to do for this couple. We brought them their healthy baby boy and I’m so thankful for that. NF: What would you tell someone who feels called to become a surrogate? If you feel called to be a surrogate, don’t be discouraged by what you think will disqualify you. Get your medical records reviewed by a doctor to determine if you would qualify to be a surrogate. Some people think they can’t become a surrogate if they have had a miscarriage or their tubes tied. I learned you don’t actually have to have your tubes, because the baby is placed inside your uterus. Don’t let the fear of being disqualified stop you from trying. There are so many intended parents out there that are waiting for their miracle, for someone to help them create a family. You could be the one that completes their family, so just look into it. NF: You’ve completed a journey successfully and brought so much joy to your intended parents. You’ve set out in this great adventure with your husband and family in an RV while homeschooling your kids. What’s next? Everyone wants to know if we are going to do another journey! I wish sometimes that I was Oprah and say, “You can get a baby, you get a baby, you get a baby.” When we first started looking into surrogacy, we did not set out to do multiple journeys. We have loved sharing our life and inspiring so many people and because the journey went so, well, why not do it again? Right now, we’re just waiting on the timing of it; maybe you’ll see another journey in the future. Read the full blog about Sam’s Surrogacy journey on our Medium.com surrogacy blog!

    "content": "The decision to pump breast milk is a shared decision between a surrogate and her intended parents, with some surrogates opting not to pump, others pumping briefly, and some providing milk for an extended period. It’s important to note that exclusively pumping for donation differs from pumping for your own child, so ensuring it works for both you and the intended family is essential. If you choose to pump, it’s crucial to know how to maintain and increase your milk supply. Regular pumping, staying hydrated, and proper nutrition are key strategies. Additionally, ensuring the breast pump is high-quality and fits well can significantly impact your ability to maintain and increase your milk supply. Whether or not you decide to pump, the choice should align with both your needs and those of your intended parents. What is surrogate milk donation? After giving birth, the surrogate may choose to extend their surrogacy journey and pump breast milk for the surrobabe. This is a common part of the surrogacy process and can range from the first part of the child’s life and some even extend the amount of time they pump for their Intended Family. Some parents know they would like to have a surrogate pump before their surrogacy journey begins, while others make the decision during the surrogacy process, or choose not to have the surrogate pump for them. Any agreement the surrogate and intended family makes will be included, or amended, in the surrogacy agreement. If the Intended Parents do not wish for the surrogate to pump, she can donate her breast milk to a milk bank or she may choose to suppress lactation, more commonly known as drying up her milk supply. Do you have to pump for your intended family? As part of our Matching Matters process, ConceiveAbilities matching experts will ask you whether you intend to pump and this topic will be addressed during the initial match meeting with your IPs. Although you may be asked about your thoughts on pumping, you do not need to make the choice early in the process and can wait until you are further in your surrogacy journey to make your final decision. Pumping after delivery is not a requirement for surrogates, nor is it an expectation. If your intended parents want to feed their baby breast milk and you are either unable or choose not to provide it, ConceiveAbilities staff will help them to explore other options, such as milk banks. If you do decide to pump or donate your milk after your surrogacy journey, lactation expert Lenna Gregory of Mother’s Milk Bank has some pro pumping, shipping and donating tips. If you are undecided on whether or not you want to pump, here is a short list of pros and cons to help you sort out whether pumping as a surrogate is right for you. Pros of Pumping As a Gestational Surrogate 1) Surrogacy Pumping Community Already Exists Although the idea of pumping as a surrogate may be new to you, there are many women who have been sharing their ideas and providing support for one another for many years. A quick Google search results in dozens of online resources and communities that are all devoted to pumping surrogates. These networks like La Leche League are a rich resource capable of providing you with both practical insight and inspiration. We especially recommend checking out this Pumping After A Surrogacy Pregnancy Facebook group. There are also great resources and lactation experts like Balanced Beginnings to help you navigate your pumping journey. 2) Pumping Is Good for your Health Pumping promotes nearly all of the healing and health benefits that breastfeeding does. Specifically, pumping will help with your fourth trimester recovery by shrinking your uterus, burning extra calories, and helping reduce uterine bleeding after birth. Plus, pumping releases oxytocin, a powerful hormone linked to love, trust, and pair bonding. All of this leads to great outcomes for your health including Increasing calorie burn Reducing the mother’s risk of breast and ovarian cancer Reducing type 2 diabetes Reducing high blood pressureHere is a great resource from America College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists about how to prepare to pump after giving birth. 3) Breast Milk is Liquid Gold Breast Milk is full of antibodies that help babies to fight off viruses and bacteria. The milk you provide will help bolster your surrobaby’s immunity and decrease episodes of diarrheal illness, ear infections, severe lower respiratory tract infections, diabetes, obesity, and sudden infant death syndrome. No wonder the American Academy of Pediatrics considers breastmilk the most ‘optimal form of nutrition’ for infants. Read more about breastfeeding benefits! Complete nutrition for infant Antibodies that build strong immune system Protection from diseases like diabetes type 1, asthma and sudden infant death syndrome Learn more tips on how to maintain and increase your milk supply from lactation expert Nikki Bredeson. 4) Pumping is Easier than Ever Some insurance companies, and possibly your intended parents, will cover the cost of your breast pump and lactation counselor. There is a lot of pumping equipment on the market, so choose the best pump for you. There are some very innovative, new products on the market that makes pumping easier than ever like The Willow™ Pump, which was the first wearable breast pump that fits in your bra with no external tubes, cords, or dangling bottles to hold you back. You can pump while vacuuming, shopping at Target, you name it! There are also inventive products like Freeze It Flat by Mammaway and Milkify, which freeze dries breast milk. 5) Pumping Compensation One of our most frequently asked surrogate questions is, “If I choose to pump for my intended family, will I be compensated?” The answer is yes, you will receive additional compensation in addition to the rest of your surrogate pay. Although compensation is likely not one of your primary motivations, you will be compensated by your intended parent(s) for extending your surrogacy journey and that will be included in your mutually agreed upon gestational carrier agreement. This is in addition to your All-In Surrogate Care & Compensation Package. 6) You Can Donate Your Milk And Make A Difference Many of our surrogates have questions about donating breast milk after their surrogacy pregnancy, in addition to pumping for their surrobabe. Donating human milk can have a life-saving impact for babies born everyday. In the United States, 450,000 babies are born prematurely every year, and others struggle with serious illness. These fragile babies will survive and thrive thanks to the generosity of human milk donors who give the critical nourishment they need. Just one ounce of breast milk can feed a baby in a neonatal intensive care unit for an entire day. Read more about how to donate your milk. While there are so many pros to pumping for your surrobaby, there are reasons why pumping may not be the right choice for you. Cons of Pumping As a Gestational Surrogate 1) Timing: Pumping is Hard Work Although it is easier now than ever, exclusively pumping can take some work and it may still cause multiple interruptions to your daily and nightly schedule. For some busy mamas, fitting this additional task into their schedules is just not a possibility. 2) Shipping Milk is Tricky Shipping to Intended Parents who are not local may be extra work to both pump your breast milk and also ship it. Since breast milk is perishable, you will have to follow some strict instructions to assure that it arrives fit for consumption. You and your Intended Family will make the shared decision on how often your ship. Make certain you and your Intended Parents have discussed not only compensation for breast milk but also reimbursement for costs associated with shipping as you may be surprised how expensive it is to ship a week’s worth of milk cross-country. Watch this video featuring lactation expert Lenna Gregory on how to pump, ship or donate your breast milk after your surrogacy pregnancy delivery. 3) Uninterested Intended Parents Some intended parents may not want to have their surrogate pump. If you find yourself in this situation, willing and wanting to pump, your Match Manager can try to find you another intended family that wants donor breast milk or you can consider donating your milk to a milk bank. With the infant baby formula shortage and lasting effects of the pandemic, milk banks urgently need replenishing. Many hospitals also are interested in donated breast milk for premature babies.

We’d only been married for 8 years when I started my first surrogacy journey. We have two children, a 26 year old daughter and an 18 year old son. I love to travel, be on the water, and am always looking to try something new! KRISTINA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY When my son was in kindergarten, one of his classmate’s mother was a surrogate. She was the first surrogate I had ever met, so initially I turned to her with a few questions and for more information. While I knew what a surrogate was, I had never met one before. At this time, I was nearing the maximum age to become a surrogate. Although I was in the process of furthering my education, things at home were pretty stable as was my job as a labor and delivery nurse. I decided to apply and see what became of it. I am so glad that I did! WHAT MAKES KRISTINA COURAGEOUS Most people in my life have had nothing but the kindest things to say about what I have done. However, my father initially did not understand what would compel me to become a surrogate. Interestingly enough, by the time I was carrying for my second and third sets of intended parents, it was this same man who couldn’t not tell anyone he met about what I was doing fast enough! He sure was proud of the gift I was giving these families, and I think that watching everything unfold throughout my first journey helped him understand the magnitude of this gift. KRISTINA’S PURPOSE: Hands down, the most rewarding part of my surrogacies has been watching my intended parents see a child they dreamed about enter the world. It truly brings the initial aspect of a journey full circle. The friendship and updates I get from these families I helped create has been equally rewarding. Inspired by Kristina?

I am a small business consultant, my husband is a financial advisor, and my kids are involved in dance, gymnastics, soccer, and softball. KRISTIN’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I couldn’t imagine not being a mother, and if I could help another couple have the child they so badly wanted, I figured why not? My husband and I had already completed our family, so we moved forward with the application process. I was matched with a wonderful couple from my home state, and since I no longer live there, this made our connection special! I had a little girl for them and we still keep in close contact. I am very grateful to ConceiveAbilities for matching me with this amazing family! WHAT MAKES KRISTIN COURAGEOUS If you’re considering becoming a surrogate, make sure you and your partner/support system are 100% sure that this is the right time for you. Be prepared for more than a 9 month commitment. My journey started in 2018 and I delivered in 2020. I also pumped afterwards, so all in all, it was about 3 years. It is beyond worth it, but it is a commitment and you will need/want support. KRISTIN’S PURPOSE The feeling I experienced is not something you can really describe. Having the ability to help a family grow while having the support that I had from my loved ones is just incredible! The BEST part of the entire journey was seeing the look on the intended parents’ faces when their daughter was born. Bringing a life into the world is an amazing feeling. Inspired by Kristin?

I’m Kristi, and I’m an Early Childhood Education teacher currently living in Denver with my daughter, McKenzie, and working as a full-time nanny. My favorite hobbies include crafting, cooking, and gardening. On the weekends, my daughter and I love to get out of the house and check out local activities around town, like farmers markets, hiking, and visiting the bookstore. KRISTI’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I have always loved kids! My background is in early childhood development and I worked in the classroom with infants and toddlers and was always around children, babysitting and nannying, from a young age. I worked with parents as well, and sometimes they were older parents. I often heard stories about fertility issues, which inspired me to become a surrogate. My heart really wanted me to do this for a family in need, and I decided to answer the call! WHAT MAKES KRISTI COURAGEOUS As a single mom, I was finally able to fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming a surrogate. My daughter is 11 years old and was amazing through the whole process. She loved telling people “this baby is not coming home with us” and was happy to maintain her status as an only child. Being a surrogate truly allowed me to enjoy every aspect of the pregnancy. KRISTI’S PURPOSE: My purpose has always been to help others who have a strong desire to become parents. I felt like I have been “called” to be a surrogate. At the end of my journey, the moment the baby was delivered, tears of pure joy ran down my face! The joy of seeing her parents getting to hold their baby for the first time. That moment was exactly why I wanted to be a surrogate! Read more about Kristi’s surrogacy journey on Mile High Mamas: How To Become A Surrogate In Denver. Inspired by Kristi?

We have two children, Carter and Arie. We love bike rides, family game nights, and the Chicago Bulls! HANNAH’S CALLING TO SURROGACY The family I worked for throughout college had twins via a surrogate, which was something I found beautiful and fascinating. Once we had our own kids, I knew that I wanted to become a surrogate, myself. Having had two relatively easy pregnancies and labor/deliveries, and knowing so many people who either had negative experiences or had fertility issues, I knew I had to do it. WHAT MAKES HANNAH COURAGEOUS I applied to be a ConceiveAbilities surrogate in January 2019, was matched in March, and had my transfer in December. At about 16 weeks, COVID-19 shut down everything in Chicago. I stayed in touch with the intended family through Face Time, and they came a few weeks before the due date, We visited with them and their 2-year-old daughter until the baby was born in August 2020. She is absolutely amazing! HANNAH’S PURPOSE Honestly, I love the feeling of being pregnant, and to know that I can do that while also providing someone with the gift of family is like a completely blissful win-win situation for me! Becoming a surrogate changed my life because I’ve been able to spread awareness of surrogacyas an option for having a family. Most of my family and friends had not heard much about surrogacy or had preconceived ideas about what it entails, and I was able to share my experience and help the people around me gain a better understanding of the process.

I own and operate my own custom cake company, The Cake Box Miami. I documented my surrogacy journey in Miami, Florida on my Instagram Surrogacy Diaries. ANDREA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I can’t remember a time when I didn’t think about being a surrogate. It has always been something that was placed in my heart! Looking back, my mom always instilled helping others into our lives growing up, and I definitely think that made a big impact on my decision. My aunt also almost became a surrogate when I was younger, so that might have planted that first seed. WHAT MAKES ANDREA COURAGEOUS I was most anxious about meeting my IP’s in person. Even though we had met via Zoom and had emailed for several months before the transfer, you just never know! They are amazing. I was also really nervous about the injections, but, they really weren’t all that bad.

I work outside the home at a local non-profit, although since COVID I’ve been lucky enough to work remotely. My family and I enjoy hiking, the outdoors, adventures and family time. TOBI’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I wanted to become a surrogate ever since the birth of my oldest son. Being able to be part of that moment of giving someone their child was something that really spoke to me. I was lucky enough to have easy pregnancies and deliveries with my own children, so I thought, why not?! After the birth of our youngest son, we knew that our family was complete. After I finished nursing him, I was certain the time was right to pursue surrogacy! WHAT MAKES TOBI COURAGEOUS After signing up with ConceiveAbilities, I was matched pretty quickly with a couple just a few states away. This was all right when COVID lock downs began, so it was a crazy time! I drove down to the clinic in New Jersey for my medical work up, and we had our first embryo transfer September 2020. It was successful, although we unfortunately had an early miscarriage discovered at our 8 week monitoring appointment. After a long few months getting back my body back on track after the D&C, we had our second transfer March 2021. I am now 26 weeks pregnant with my IPs baby girl! TOBI’S PURPOSE Pushing through uncertainty and the difficult moments that occurred throughout the IVF process and the first half of the pregnancy was tough. We had a bumpy road, so persevering through that to get where we are today is very rewarding. I now know all the sacrifices I made were worthwhile! Inspired by Tobi?

I’m a Licensed Professional Counselor and I was able to complete two life changing journeys for two amazing families. TISHA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I have known what surrogacy was even before starting my own family, however it truly became a dream of mine after my son was born. My sister-in-law was having difficulty becoming pregnant, which hurt me deeply. I knew in my heart that surrogacy was my next step to help another family. Before embarking on this journey, I had never met another woman who had been a surrogate. What I did know was that I had a wonderful pregnancy with my son and myself, plus my husband, were 100% all in for a surrogacy journey! WHAT MAKES TISHA COURAGEOUS Maybe it was excitement, joy, or unknowns; but I didn’t have many fears. I was most nervous about the hormones/medications, however when I am ready for something I jump in feet first, which is what I did with my first and second journey. I look at life as having purpose and meaning so any fears/anxieties about the journey were over-arched by the purpose I felt. Since my first journey was over 9 years ago, my friends and family had questions, since surrogacy wasn’t as prevalent back then as it is now. However, everyone was very supportive of my decision to help others. TISHA’S PURPOSE: Surrogacy became my passion and led me to begin working with ConceiveAbilities. I have been able to utilize my background as a licensed counselor and previous surrogacies to now help many other families/surrogates. Inspired by Tisha?

We’ve been married for 16 years and have two teenage daughters, ages 12 and 14. Even though we live in the suburbs, we often joke that we live “on the farm,” as we have 2 ducks, 6 chickens and a long list of other pets! PAULA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I’ve been a gestational carrier three times now. However, the first time I thought about trying to help another family have a child was in 2009. It was not one specific person who inspired me, rather a collection of stories that I heard from other moms I knew through a mom’s group I belonged to. Through their stories and the stories of couples close to them who struggled with infertility, I was inspired to look into the surrogacy process. WHAT MAKES PAULA COURAGEOUS Initially, I was most anxious about not knowing how long the process would take. However, that was quickly explained by ConceiveAbilities and the IVF clinic. My husband was extremely supportive and excited about the process from the beginning. My friends and family thought it was strange at first, but were quick to share in my excitement once they learned more. My husband was my biggest and constant support. He listened to me when needed, cared for the house and children, and understood why being a surrogate was important to me. I was surprised by how extremely fulfilled I felt after the delivery of the first baby. Even though I anticipated that the journey would be rewarding, nothing could prepare me for how life changing the delivery was and how I would want to continue to help other families after that. PAULA’S PURPOSE: Being a surrogate has changed my life in many ways. It gave me a new appreciation for my own children and husband, humbled me to realize how challenging it is for some intended parents to have a child/children, and it gave me the opportunity to work in this field helping others to build their families.

I’m 35 years old and am a real estate agent in the Atlanta area who loves to travel, be outside, exercise, and eat good food. I have three children; Levi, Reeves and my only daughter, Londyn. I had my first surrobaby in May of 2018, and he lives in New York City with his mom, dad, and big sister. LORIAHN’S CALLING TO SURROGACY Several years ago, a friend of mine was a ConceiveAbilities surrogate who shared her journey online. This was actually the first time I had ever heard about surrogacy! Since I’d had three easy pregnancies, I knew I wanted to research it more. It’s always been a life goal of mine to find a way to help someone in a way that couldn’t help themselves, and surrogacy seemed like an amazing way to do that. In March 2017, I was matched with my first intended family and immediately knew they were the right couple for me. We had a successful natural cycle transfer that September, and I delivered their healthy baby boy in May 2018. I was matched with my second amazing intended family in March 2021, and we had our transfer in September 2021. In fact, I actually just got a great beta number to let me know this transfer was successful as well! WHAT MAKES LORIAHN COURAGEOUS My partner has been amazing… giving me shots and meds and just in general being very supportive of my desire to do this again. My family and friends have been incredibly happy for me and the families I have helped. They all think it’s just the most generous thing, and while I agree that it is generous, I also just feel so blessed and honored that I’m able to help a family have a baby. LORIAHN’S PURPOSE The most rewarding part of my journey was the moment the parents got to meet their baby for the first time. It was emotional and sweet and the happiest day for everyone involved! Also, getting the privilege to watch this little baby become a toddler, and then a big kid, and just knowing that you helped this little person have this beautiful life.

My husband is in the Air Force, and we honestly never expected to get stationed here, so it was quite a surprise! Alaska is beautiful, and we fully enjoy the 22 hours of sunlight in the summer when you will find us salmon fishing, hiking, camping, and tending our overwhelming garden. In the winter we enjoy downhill and cross-country skiing. In my free time, I love reading, traveling, and doing hot yoga! LACI’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I was introduced to surrogacy during my first pregnancy. Before I became pregnant, my husband and I had gotten married thinking that children may not be in our future. Our first pregnancy was such a surprise, and quite emotional as we had been mentally preparing for this day to never happen. When I heard about surrogacy, I developed a deep kinship with the idea as I knew what it felt like to not have children. Now that I was able to have children, I knew I had to help other women who could not! WHAT MAKES LACI COURAGEOUS I was most anxious about causing my intended parents more pain. By the time most intended parents come to surrogacy, they have suffered loss, or the pain of not being able to conceive – The last thing I wanted was for this pregnancy to not work out. I quickly realized that I was worrying about the uncontrollable, and we just took it day by day. Once we hit 12 weeks gestation, we were able to relax and enjoy the pregnancy, and dream about the delivery day! LACI’S PURPOSE: The most amazing moment was when my intended parents were handed their baby. The emotion that overtook the room was deeply moving and made every shot, appointment, and pregnancy pain worth it! Additionally, our continued friendship with them has been so rewarding.

I have a few friends who have been surrogates in the past, so when surrogacy finally became legal in our state in 2019, I started the surrogate application process. When it came time to meet our potential match, we talked on Zoom for hours! By the time we were ready to hang up, we had all already agreed that we wanted to move forward with starting this journey together! WHAT MAKES SARAH COURAGEOUS At first, my husband didn’t know much about surrogacy, so he did research and was supportive of my decision. My mom and siblings were happy that I was able to do this for someone, and my friends thought it was so wonderful! As a mother myself, I couldn’t imagine not being able to have a family of my own, so I wanted to help someone become a parent and grow their own little family. SARAH’S PURPOSE: I am so thankful to have done this for my intended parents. Being a surrogate for a family in need is such a unique experience – I helped them have a child of their own! Not only are you helping the parents, but you may be giving someone a grandchild or sibling or cousin. I feel so blessed to have been able to do this for them! The parents tell me they are thankful for me every single day. If you want to help a family out, have the time and are healthy enough to become a surrogate, go for it! It is such a rewarding experience for everyone involved. Inspired by Sarah? Calling All Surrogates Are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy?

My husband Rolando and I have been married since 2008, and our son Benjamin completed our family in 2012. Benjamin keeps us busy with karate, soccer, choir, and chess club. We recently rescued two cats and they have brought a lot of laughs into our home. ROBYN’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I initially applied to be a ConceiveAbilities egg donor before switching paths to surrogacy, and I’m so happy I did! Having now been a two-time surrogate, I have so much to be proud of and so many happy memories to look back on. I matched with my first couple in March 2013, we successfully transferred in November, and a healthy boy was delivered in July 2014. It didn’t take very long for me to decide on a second journey, and I matched with another family in May 2015. I safely delivered in June 2016. Becoming a surrogate opened my eyes to the realities of infertility that I’d never really been exposed to in my life. WHAT MAKES ROBYN COURAGEOUS It’s been over five years since my surrogacy journey, and I feel like my heart has been telling me to do this one last time for a while now. I’m very hopeful for a third journey! ROBYN’S PURPOSE: What could be more rewarding than seeing the look of absolute awe and love on new parents’ faces? Not only was I lucky enough to help complete two families, but realizing that you’re making parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles… the impact of these journeys is deeper than we initially imagine.

We recently relocated from Florida to Northeast Georgia for my husband’s job and for a fresh start. MICHELLE’S CALLING TO SURROGACY I came across an article in People magazine about a surrogacy agency which got me really interested in surrogacy, so I started researching more about other surrogates. I read a lot of stories from the perspective of the intended parent, and realized how difficult it must be to want to have a baby so badly when your body just won’t cooperate. This really got me thinking – I had two very easy pregnancies and thought I could easily do it again for someone else! My husband and I talked and agreed that it would be an amazing thing to do for a family. That’s when I came across ConceiveAbilities and reached out to find out more about the surrogacy process. I was eventually matched with a wonderful family from New Jersey and we connected almost right away. WHAT MAKES MICHELLE COURAGEOUS When we moved to Georgia, I became a stay at home mom. My older son was in kindergarten and my younger son was going to be starting school the following year. Knowing that they would be more independent and out of the diaper, bottle, toddler stages helped make the decision easy. I thought, “what better time to start this journey?” Becoming a surrogate has helped give me a sense of purpose and a feeling of being grateful for what I have in my own life. MICHELLE’S PURPOSE The most rewarding part of this experience has been getting to know the intended mother. She is such a sweet person and she sends me cards and little gifts all the time to let me know how grateful she is to have me. It makes me feel so good inside that I can help her!

I’m Ashtin, I currently live in Indiana with my amazing husband of 11 years, Jeff, and our three beautiful kids, two boys (Masen and Brooks) and a girl (Gracie) and we can’t forget Winston, our french bulldog. I’m a two-time surrogate (sibling journey) to Silas and Sloane. ASHTIN’S CALLING TO SURROGACY Being a surrogate has always been on my mind. My husband and I started dating in high school and got married just after college; I remember a few conversations where we spoke about helping another family have children once our family was complete. Even then, without knowing anything about surrogacy, he never questioned me. About a year after we decided our family was complete, a childhood friend came back into my life. She was on her first journey carrying a beautiful little boy for the most deserving dads-to-be. I knew in my heart I was ready. The rest was history, I applied in March 2018, delivered the most perfect little boy March 17, 2019, and completed Brian and Scott’s family on June 4th, 2020, with their sweet little girl. WHAT MAKES ASHTIN COURAGEOUS I never questioned being able to detach myself from the pregnancy. I knew from the second I met Brian and Scott, it was about them. I was always focused on them, every little milestone was always for them. I think that potential surrogates are already aware and open if they come into the process – and being a little nervous is normal. My comfort was my relationship with my intended dads. That connection was my drive. ASHTIN’S PURPOSE: I honestly feel like the lucky one. There isn’t a day that passes that I don’t think about Brian, Scott, Silas and Sloane. Being a surrogate has taught me more about myself than I thought possible. I’ve not only changed my life, but I believe I’ve opened the eyes of others. I made a difference. My passion and purpose is to be a mother, and now I can add being a surrogate. I found something bigger than myself. We all gained something beautiful when surrogacy brought us together!

Originally from Upstate New York, I moved to Maui, Hawaii where I met my husband, Nick. Eventually we settled in Minnesota, where Nick was born and raised, with our only son, Jack. AMANDA’S CALLING TO SURROGACY My surrogate journey started right after I had Jack. After his birth, my love for him was overwhelming and I felt every person wanting children should get to feel this! I heard about surrogacy on a podcast I was listening to, and decided to look into it – I was hooked! I applied and was surprised about how fast things moved along. Becoming a surrogate felt like a purpose and destiny for me. I knew it was the right time because our son was young and we didn’t plan on having any more children of our own. WHAT MAKES AMANDA COURAGEOUS My husband was so supportive of my dreams. My friends were also there for me and thought it was a selfless gift I was giving to someone. At first, my family was concerned and didn’t understand, until I explained it wasn’t genetically my baby – Then they were on board and supported me 100 percent! My advice to someone wanting to be a surrogate is to be patient and let things happen as they should. My first journey took 3 years due to failed transfers and waiting for the parents to make new embryos. It all worked out in the end, but it did take patience.

    "content": "Pregnancy and Chiropractic Care Can chiropractic care help during pregnancy? Dr. Jo Nell Shaw, a chiropractor and naturopathic doctor at Shaw Family Practice in Fort Collins, Colorado, believes the world needs healthy moms, and she is on a mission to improve the experience of being a woman in the modern world. Dr. Shaw shared how going to the chiropractor can benefit pregnancy, delivery and fourth trimester postpartum recovery after a surrogacy journey. Whether you are just thinking about becoming a surrogate, pregnant, or in your fourth trimester recovery, your health is important. Our All In Surrogate Care & Compensation Package includes partum care from the beginning all the way through your fourth trimester, including information on how to take care of your body pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy and postpartum. Can you explain what a chiropractor is? A chiropractor is somebody who looks at the nervous system and a person’s spinal integrity. We look at the joints of the body, the joints of the head, and the spine. They’ll make sure that they’re all aligned and that your nervous system is functioning well. That’s important to the connection between the brain and body. When a joint is not moving well, you’re going to feel pain and there’s going to be muscle tension around it. Your brain is constantly getting feedback that the body is not where you think it is. You need to fix it. We do have that very gentle touch. It’s not like the YouTube videos that you’ll see on chiropractors where they’re just popping everything. The whole idea of bone cracking is a myth. We are not cracking bones, we are moving joints. What is a naturopathic doctor? A naturopathic physician, or naturopathic doctor, is somebody who basically uses nature and the laws of nature to change someone’s physiology. We’re looking at people as a whole ecosystem. So it’s not just all of the organ systems of your body, but it’s also the environment that you’ve been in, any exposures that you’ve had from environmental toxins or genetic discrepancies. We also look a lot at people’s experience of the world, including any kind of trauma or events that have happened to them. We start basically peeling back the layers to figure out what the actual cause is of a particular health issue. What are some of the main benefits of someone going to a chiropractor doctor like you? Often people will seek out chiropractors because they are in pain, although we do a lot more than just relieving pain. Anytime that your body alignment is not correct, you may actually start seeing other systems in your body start to communicate, telling you they’re not doing well either. That’s not always painful. For instance, if somebody has sluggish digestion or constipation, I can address that. We’re looking at the body and how it’s adapting to all of the information that it’s giving the brain and, in return, how the brain is sending that back and changing the function of organs, muscles and joints. Your mission is to improve the experience of being a woman in the modern world. How do you do that through chiropractic care? I find that many women are trying to do everything for everyone around them. In order to make their life better, I demonstrate that taking time to focus on themselves is essential. It starts to empower them and put them in a role where they’re not putting themselves on the back burner and letting their health deteriorate. I see that a lot with women who end up having auto-immune conditions. Oftentimes, when we start peeling back the layers, they will then say, “Wow, I really wish I would’ve seen a chiropractor sooner because I would have really changed the way I was living my life.” You can imagine how running ragged for a really long time will cause these women’s health to really start hurting. This doesn’t affect just them, but everyone around them because they can’t show up and be fully present with their kids or their spouse. They’re missing days of work because they are in pain, and now they have a health crisis that they feel came out of nowhere. When we ask, “When did it start?”, they realize it has been going on for over a decade and felt it was just not a big enough issue to do anything about it at that time. What pregnancy issues can chiropractic care help solve? A major one is breech pregnancies. Chiropractic care helps by actually changing the mom’s anatomy. If you think about the natural curvature of someone’s spine, pregnant women end up having a large mass, the baby, in front of them. This causes their spine and back to really curve. Posture changes as the weight of the baby keeps increasing, and the body has to stretch and change with that. If she doesn’t have really good alignment, it’s not going to stretch and change optimally; compensations will occur which end up creating hip and shoulder pain. There are ligaments that go from the tailbone to the uterus. If your tailbone is not in good alignment, your uterus gets a bit twisted. It’s like a hot air balloon, with ropes on it; if one of those ropes is tighter, that hot air balloon is going to bend differently than if they were both symmetrical side to side. Women with asymmetries run the risk of having a harder delivery, worse birth outcomes and a harder postpartum recovery. What is the Webster technique? The Webster technique is a chiropractic technique geared towards helping pelvic anatomy for pregnant women. We want those ligaments going from the tailbone up to the uterus to be very symmetrical and stable. We balance out the piriformis muscles that run across your butt cheeks. We work on the front of the belly. Some women, later in pregnancy, will start having round ligament pain. That ligament is unique in that it actually has a muscle fiber running through it. It can have a trigger point in it that causes a lot of pain similar to what you get in your upper back. The Webster technique is focused on a pregnant woman and all about improving her anatomy to create the best environment for the baby to be in. Not every chiropractor is trained in pregnancy, so I encourage women to turn to resources like the International Chiropractic Pediatric Associationto find Webster certified chiropractors. What exercises do you recommend pregnant women do throughout their pregnancy? I teach women what are called rest smart postures. These are ways to, for instance, sit in chairs or to move from lying down to sitting up in a way that doesn’t hurt your alignment. By utilizing these postures, women help to prevent pressure in the abdomen and reduce the chances of diastasis recti, which is a condition where the abdominal muscles separate. Not only do these postures help women recover faster from pregnancy, they help women to be more comfortable during that nine to 10 months of gestation. I also encourage pregnant women to do assisted squats. For example, doing a goddess squat stretches the perineum and helps to ensure that the legs are building endurance. Chiropractic care can help that and make the delivery go much more effectively! How can a surrogate’s partner help? I show partners techniques so that they can help women really feel comfortable throughout pregnancy and delivery. There’s one technique that I’ll have partners learn to help women when she wakes up in the middle of the night with hip pain, which helps everybody get a better night’s sleep. That same technique can be used later on during delivery, by opening up the pelvic outlet, contractions are more effective and the baby can come out easier. How do you use chiropractic care for surrogates? Going through pregnancy with the intention that you are growing a baby lovingly and giving that to the intended parents is amazing. Pregnancy is still challenging for a surrogate’s body and having a strong connection to her own anatomy is incredibly important. When I talk to these women about their experiences, they’ll tell me it was one of the greatest gifts that they could ever give someone. I want to make sure that their pregnancies and healing go as amazing as possible because I want that gift to continue to be something that they can cherish. How does a chiropractor help the surrogate and her family? We want to be able to make sure that surrogates can adapt to their changing bodies. They still have a family that they have to take care of, on top of caring for themselves. I work with women to give them the energy that they need while growing the baby. Our nervous system is going to be key in managing any kind of stress and chiropractic care helps ensure the brain and body are connected and working well together. When a surrogate has little ones at home that she’s taking care of while pregnant, if she’s uncomfortable she’s going to be grumpier because pregnancy can be such a drain on women. When a surrogate is comfortable, that is a huge gift and hopefully she is thinking, “Oh my gosh, this is the best pregnancy I’ve ever had!” That is the feedback that I get often and I want that for every surrogate. Do you have advice for the surrogates who are preparing for birth? Look at some rest smart positions. When you’re sitting down, you want your sitz bones, the deep bones in your pelvic outlet, to be on the surface and your feet are going to be wide and angled out. You want your belly to drop in between your legs to allow the gravity and weight of the baby to help stretch your muscles. Also, move often and eat as many vegetables as you can. Fiber is going to keep things really comfortable. As long as your digestion is doing well, you’ll be able to get anything that’s being mobilized out of your body. If your body doesn’t move with ease, find a chiropractor that can help. Consider yoga, too; there are plenty of free pregnancy based yoga programs on YouTube! Does a chiropractor have any benefit for intended parents as well? If an infant is uncomfortable and if they have problems pooping, feeding, or sleeping, those are all indications that a chiropractor can be helpful. Babies have had a stressful event during the birthing process, which impacts their entire body. If a baby is more comfortable, they’re going to feed better, poop with ease and sleep better too! I always tell parents to look at their children to see if their face is symmetrical. If you see one eye too small or closed, that’s going to be an indication that there’s something happening in the head shape that we can change. Also, look for a head tilt. That often can change the way that your child interprets the world. It’s also important that their mouth is opening and closing while feeding. If they’re uncomfortable trying to suck on anything, that’s another indication that a chiropractor could be helpful in getting their palate and their skull structure accustomed to being outside of a body. What role does a chiropractor have in the 4th trimester postpartum time? Fourth trimester postpartum care for surrogates does look different. Helping these women to feel at home again in their bodies while recovering from pregnancy is the goal. We address any complications from pregnancy, whether there was tearing, pain, or separation of abdominal muscles. All of her organs had to shift while she was pregnant and now they have to shift back. We work with that organ anatomy. I want to make sure that women are feeling their life is going the way that they intended. If a woman is struggling with pain, fatigue, or feelings of unworthiness, that’s something that I’m trained to help with. Having care providers who can address those needs is essential. If they’re in Colorado, they can come and work with me. If not, I can help put them in touch with people in their area. I really want to make sure that every woman is able to live the life that they want and feel good in their bodies. What is your advice for women who are considering becoming a surrogate? If you love being pregnant, I would definitely investigate. Talk to other surrogates to learn about their experience. The conversations that I’ve had have been extremely valuable because these women have said how much they loved it and how it was such a gift that they would do it again. On a clinical note, I know that a lot of women say they feel best when pregnant and that’s awesome. Somebody who truly enjoys that experience of being pregnant can be a great surrogate. Being a surrogate can be hard, so make sure that you have a community around you who understands your choices! When making this decision, think about the risks, the benefits, and the alternatives. Make sure that this is the best choice for you and your family and then there will be no regrets. You can listen to other people, but tap into yourself and really use that as a guide to decide what would be best for you and your immediate family and go from there.

    "content": "Acupuncture and Pregnancy Sarah Thompson of Sacred Vessel Acupuncture and Functional Medicine specializes in fertility care all the way through postpartum care with a primary focus on pregnancy. Sarah shares how acupuncture and functional medicine can help pregnant women and surrogates in their pregnancy. What is Acupuncture? Traditional Chinese Medicine is an ancient medical theory rooted in a long and rich history. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very thin needles into specific acupuncture points. Modern Acupuncture is based on the understanding of how Acupuncture affects the biochemistry of the body. The insertion of small needles into strategic Acupuncture points elicit a series of endocrine, hormonal and biochemical reactions in the body. We combine the ancient knowledge with the modern knowledge to bring together the strengths of both medical models to improve treatment success. What Is Functional Medicine? Functional medicine takes Western physiology that we all know and love and combines it with clinical nutrition. We look at the different physiological processes of the body. When we’re looking at fertility, we’re looking at how the ovary works, the growth of the end endometrial lining and the hormones responsible for that, and how nutrition plays into those functions in the body. You have over 20 years of experience working with medical doctors in the fields of pain management and OB/GYN. How do you work hand in hand with these doctors while treating a pregnant patient? I’ve been at this for a long time and I’ve definitely practiced in medical offices, which has been fantastic. I worked in an OB/GYN clinic for a number of years and that allowed me to understand their modalities of treatment. We often collaborate with physicians and midwives, discussing patient care and what we are doing nutritionally to support these women. We work together to make sure we meet our goal of a happy, healthy pregnancy, a happy, healthy birth and a happy, healthy baby! You also became a doula. Why? I worked with women in different facets of fertility and different facets of pregnancy. It was always a hard thing for me to part with my patients when it was time for labor. Now as a doula, I can offer continuity of care from IVF transfer or conception all the way through delivery. We get their body prepared for labor and I get to be there with them to support them through that process. Have you worked with surrogates? We’ve definitely helped surrogates prepare their bodies for the IVF transfer process so that they can accept that embryo successfully. We also care for surrogates through pregnancy to make sure that not only is the baby growing well, but that their body is also supporting the pregnancy correctly. We use a lot of functional medicine and acupuncture to help facilitate this. Are there any specific points in the body that you are focusing on during pregnancy? The maternal body changes drastically from literally the day of conception all the way through three months postpartum, a period known as the fourth trimester. There’s all these lovely little strategic spots through gestation that I focus on because they’re very important. These acupuncture points vary throughout pregnancy. One of our key points we emphasize is the happy baby point, which is on the inside of the calf muscle. It increases blood flow to the uterus which increases oxygen, adrenaline and nutrient flow into that baby. How can surrogates prepare themselves for birth? The best thing you can do when preparing for birth is to start early. Focus on nutrition throughout pregnancy because it makes a big difference in how that birth goes. I have a new book, Functional Maternity, that talks about the disciplines of functional medicine throughout pregnancy. A whole chapter is dedicated to preparation for childbirth because it’s so important. Traditionally, we think of preparation for childbirth as being the last couple weeks of gestation starting at 36 weeks. The actual changes in maternal physiology that go into labor and delivery, however, starts at around 28 weeks. So, with our surrogate mothers and moms in general, we really want them to do certain things starting at 28 weeks to understand how their body is changing and what they need to be doing nutritionally. This allows those changes to occur optimally when they are in labor so delivery can go smoothly. What are some key pregnancy benefits of using an acupuncturist? Throughout pregnancy, there’s a number of things acupuncture can successfully treat. Morning sickness is a big one. Acupuncture is very beneficial for reducing morning sickness throughout the first trimester. We can change neurotransmitter function and hormone function at different phases in gestation. Pregnancy acupuncture is a really good option for women experiencing depression and anxiety because it’s non-medicated. We’re not worried about putting medications in the body, which could affect the growing baby. In addition, there is an excellent study that came out of Stanford years ago that found acupuncture is more effective at mitigating postpartum depression than medication. So, that’s something that we use acupuncture a lot with. The other thing is we can help facilitate the hormones that go into the activation of labor. If we have conditions where induction is a possibility, we can help move the body along a little bit and perhaps avoid induction. Hypertension is another condition we commonly treat with acupuncture and have good success rates. Why is it so important for a mom to take care of herself while pregnant? One of the things I find with maternity care in general, and maybe even more so in a surrogate situation, is we focus so much on the health of the baby that we kind of miss the mother. The woman and her health matters during the pregnancy, because if they’re not taking care of themselves and their nutritional status, their health will follow them throughout the rest of their life. This is why caring for mothers is just as important as caring for that baby. We focus a lot on the fourth trimester in our All-In Surrogate Care and Compensation Package. How can acupuncture help recovery in the postpartum fourth trimester? Acupuncture can help to balance those hormones post pregnancy. One of the big hormone issues we see postpartum is a drop in estrogen and it’s not because the mom doesn’t produce estrogen anymore. It’s because some estrogen was being produced by the baby. So, a postpartum mother has been on an estrogen high for the last several months and then she experiences an estrogen low after the baby’s birth. We can really help her body start to resolve that gap on its own with acupuncture. That’s an example of how acupuncture can play a role in changing hormones and how they are processed. How can women prepare for birth physically and emotionally? The biggest tool in anybody’s toolbox is educating yourself to know what’s going to happen in the body and what to expect. I’m a big fan of watching videos. Surrogates have had pregnancies and births before. While they understand that process a little bit, every pregnancy is different, which is why having somebody who can help guide you becomes very important. Lastly, nutrition is key! Nutrition management is an important missing aspect in many lives that can improve our birth outcomes. Do you have any advice for breast milk pumping? Make sure that the pumping mom gets enough Vitamin D. We talk a lot now about Vitamin D deficiency being a big issue in pregnancy and, more importantly, postpartum. Mothers need to consume a minimum of one thousand international units of Vitamin D for the breast milk to contain the minimum 400 international units that the baby needs to grow correctly. A lot of pediatricians are now supplementing babies with a liquid Vitamin D supplement since so few women are meeting that demand of Vitamin D in their diet. A lot of the foods that are rich in Vitamin D are things like mushrooms, seafood, and organ meats, like liver. These are also fantastic foods for the postpartum period in that fourth trimester. Nobody is a big fan of organ meat anymore, but it helps women recover from childbirth and contains all the vitamins and minerals that were lost during that third trimester and the birth experience itself. It is a fourth trimester power food! Do you have advice for a woman who is considering becoming a surrogate? In fertility management, we always say preconception nutrition is more important than pregnancy nutrition, and the same thing applies to surrogacy. What a surrogate does in those months before transfer really makes a difference on how that pregnancy is going to go for her. We have to make sure her body is in a good position to take on that embryo and to carry it full term. There are nutritional deficiencies that can inhibit that embryo from transplanting or increase the risk of miscarriages in that first trimester. Iodine deficiency is a big one and hypothyroidism can be a big trigger for a loss. Iron deficiency in the preconception phase tends to not resolve itself throughout pregnancy. We look at making sure that women have consumed enough iron before pregnancy, so we don’t have to add in supplements later on if we don’t have to, which puts her body in a better position to handle pregnancy. How can people find you? We offer nutritional support in the preconception phase, through pregnancy and postpartum in our office in Fort Collins, Colorado and by virtual appointments.

    "content": "Since the inception of ConceiveAbilities 25 years ago, there have been incredible advances in third party reproduction, especially in surrogacy. More and more families are turning to surrogacy and more to build their families and being open about their fertility journey. Dr. Ashley Tiegs with the Atlanta Center for Reproductive Medicine and winner of the ASRM 2021 Investigator Achievement award shared her own fertility journey, what inspired her to become a Reproductive Endocrinologist and how surrogacy has helped her patients build their families on our podcast All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes. NF: You have been very open about your own infertility journey. Tell us about how your path to parenthood inspired you to become a Reproductive Endocrinologist. My husband and I met when we were in medical school. He was very open with me pretty immediately that he had Hodgkin Lymphoma as a teenager and he had alkylating chemotherapy, a pretty severe type of chemotherapy which basically kills sperm and eggs. He didn’t think that we could have kids. I started my OB/GYN rotation and I learned about the subspecialty of reproductive endocrinology and infertility. It’s how I found this field of medicine. I knew that this was the only thing I wanted to do. We waited to attempt to start a family until my last year of residency. His first semen analysis showed zero sperm and we were really devastated. We repeated the same analysis and it showed two sperm. Infertility patients know that normal analysis will show tens of millions of sperm, and it only had two. I knew that we could use Assisted Reproductive Technology and succeed with an intracytoplasmic sperm injection. So there was some hope for us to have our own biological child. And, we had our first child that way with IVF. Perseverance is really the biggest key in infertility. You have to find the treatment that’s right for you. I then did three more IVF cycles really to bank embryos because the embryo development rate was always poor and the embryos were of borderline quality. We now have two perfect children. NF: Congratulations on your beautiful family. Perseverance absolutely pays off. We’ve used that perspective a lot in our agency, whether it’s one egg, one surrogate, or one sperm. Sometimes all it takes is one, so don’t give up. When is surrogacy a viable option for your patients? We recommend a gestational carrier for patients with repeated history of embryo transfer failures in the setting of good quality embryos. because we feel that the embryo factor there is controlled. Alternatively, we may recommend a gestational carrier for women where pregnancy is contraindicated; they may have a poor obstetric history or medical history where pregnancy would be too dangerous to them or to the potential baby and it would not be prudent to put them through pregnancy. We’ll also use gestational carriers for unpartnered individuals and same sex couples that do not have any fertility factors. NF: When you have a conversation with them about surrogacy, what reaction do you get? It’s not always greeted with open arms. This can be a very low point and may be a hard thing to accept for couples. No one thinks about their journey to build a family as including perhaps a third person outside of the immediate couple. The good news is that it can be highly successful and it typically is extremely successful. NF: For those struggling with infertility, the partnership with a surrogate is a uniquely good answer for couples who have been down a road of previous failures. This is a new treatment, so it gives couples hope and a solution. That’s what we all want: a solution to infertility. I think that can be really exciting for a couple. NF: How have advances allowed surrogacy to earn a title of being one of the most successful fertility treatments out there? Careful selection of the gestational carriers has made it a really successful treatment for sure. The parents can feel very comfortable knowing that we have very strict criteria for who can become a gestational carrier. So it’s looking at their obstetric history, psychological and medical evaluation, and screening of the gestational carriers. Additionally we really recommend single embryo transfer to gestational carriers. Technological advances allow for pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy allowing for that single embryo transfer and that helps the surrogate or the gestational carrier have a safe pregnancy. NF: Why is it a requirement that a surrogate not only have a healthy uterus, but a proven obstetrical history of being able to carry healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies? Obstetric histories tend to repeat themselves. We often see that. So we really don’t know what someone’s pregnancy is going to be like until they have one. So at least one pregnancy that is healthy is a really good indication that another one will be healthy as well. NF: Who makes a good gestational carrier? All the gestational carriers I’ve ever met really desire to make a major difference in people’s lives. They enjoy pregnancy. So there’s that emotional and social aspect of it. As the intended parents’ and the gestational carrier’s physician, my goal is primarily to make sure it’s a safe pregnancy. NF: Surrogacy used to be viewed as a last resort for patients undergoing fertility treatment. We are now seeing physicians speeding up that conversation about partnering with a surrogate faster than ever before. Why do you think that is? I think it’s multifaceted. With the technologic advances in our field, we have more advanced embryo diagnostics. If we find that we’ve got good quality embryos and we’re not having success, perhaps surrogacy is the best option. We’ve also solidified the connections between infertility clinics and the gestational carrier agencies. We have more access to gestational carriers. It’s only become more and more widespread and more common and socially acceptable when we’ve got celebrities sharing their experience. It’s becoming more accessible as well and so that makes it an easier option to offer to patients. NF: Surrogacy has become normalized, but there are still some myths about surrogacy. The most common surrogacy myth I encounter is that perhaps the surrogate is a traditional surrogate and that they would donate eggs and carry a pregnancy. Gestational carriers have no genetic relation to the child they are carrying for the intended parent. NF: Let’s pivot a little bit and talk about the advancements in care of the surrogate like fourth trimester support for the healing and recovery after a woman who is a gestational carrier gives birth. The fourth trimester is absolutely extremely important and is probably the most important trimester. It really is a full 12 weeks of healing. It’s very important for the body to regain its nutrients. Emotionally too. I’m so glad that this is part of ConceiveAbilities’ program and care, because the attention that is given to the gestational carriers during this time is extremely important. NF: What’s your advice to a woman who might be considering becoming a surrogate? I feel like women who are considering becoming a surrogate or a carrier, they don’t need advice. These are some of the most caring, generous people I’ve ever met. My advice is to take care of yourself. And that’s really the best way to take care of the baby that you’re carrying and to help the intended parents. NF: I couldn’t agree more. These are remarkable women: truly incredible, generous giving, tough, tenacious, and persevering. They’re really something.

Our All In Surrogate Care & Compensation Package includes partum care from the beginning all the way through your fourth trimester, including information on how you fuel your body. Nutrition is just as important for you, as it is for the baby you are carrying. And, Kendra Aronson, founder of the newly launched Pregnant and Hungry, has guidance for you. Through her subscription-based website with pregnancy-safe recipes, she created a one-stop resource for everything you need to know about what to eat, and what not to eat, during your surrogacy journey. Read on to learn more about Kendra and her advice – and listen to the full All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes! The Pregnant and Hungry Pregnancy 101 guide is a resource with all the nutrient-rich foods to benefit both you and the baby you’re carrying. This includes a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, meat, seafood, legumes, herbs, seeds, dairy, and grains, and combines all of that together in a very wholesome, holistic way. The site breaks your pregnancy nutrition plan into three main buckets: foods to eat, foods to avoid and prenatal vitamins. It also provides nuggets of information on what vitamins you need for pregnancy and why, and how to get them from natural, nutrient rich foods. For instance: what does calcium bring to the table? Calcium is responsible for healthy bone mineralization, muscle contractility and hormone functioning. When you’re pregnant, calcium requirements increase to support the formation of a new skeleton and the physiological functioning of that little body. It also brings additional benefits to the table. If you’re sufficient in calcium, you have more stable blood pressure, which decreases the risk of pregnancy induced hypertension and preterm birth. Not only do you get the 411 on great ingredients, Pregnant and Hungry shares searchable recipes for everything from how to encourage lactation to boosting energy to labor-inducing meals. Recipes are organized by pregnancy specific ailments like morning sickness, constipation, heartburn, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, or hydration. You can filter by dietary restrictions including dairy-free, gluten-free or vegetarian or cravings like sweet or salty. There is even a filter for freezer-friendly recipes for post delivery recovery during your fourth trimester. Pregnancy Tips: Think of eating well in 72 hour chunks. So instead of beating yourself up about how you ate in one 24-hour period, think of it in 72-hour periods. Give yourself grace and three days to hit all of the important categories. Consider the mantra of everything in moderation, including moderation. Most importantly, eat a well balanced diet where you can pronounce all the ingredients; no mystery preservatives or added things that should not be in food.

    "content": "While Kristin Welch is today the leader of all of our operations at ConceiveAbilities, she was the pioneer who built the foundation for what is today’s Surrogate Engagement team at ConceiveAbilities. This team welcomes, screens and vets the thousands of surrogate applications received by ConceiveAbilities every month. Kristin is an efficiency enthusiast; her knack for defining and streamlining processes has helped mold this team into the well-oiled machine it is today. As a registered nurse as well as a surrogate herself, Kristin brings a valuable perspectives to her work. We recently spoke with Kristin about how the Surrogate Engagement Team came to be and, especially, the effort made to consider the motivations of each applicant while reviewing their application. Honoring Each Applicant’s Vision “Members of the team and I have been in the shoes of these applicants before, so we understand that each woman has a vision in mind for her journey. In fact, most applicants have experienced something very specific that inspired their interest in becoming a surrogate and we aim to honor their inspiration,” states Kristin. Kristin mentions that her team often hears from applicants who specifically include on their application that they want to work with same-sex parents as a means of showing their support for the LGBT community. Other applicants specifically request to carry for a heterosexual couple struggling with infertility. Kristin adds, “Many times an applicant has had an aunt or a friend whom they loved who struggled to build their family and these applicants want to become a surrogate in honor of their loved one. Kristin says, “Our Surrogate Engagement team, as well as our Matching Matters team, works hard to ensure that each applicant’s inspiration for wanting to become a surrogate is honored.” Kristin acknowledges that occasionally an applicant’s specific vision, or a combination of very specific criteria, will require additional time to find her the right match. There are even rare occurrences when the applicant’s vision for her match is not compatible with the options available at ConceiveAbilities. In these cases, the team suggests that the applicant consider applying to a different reputable agency. Along the same lines, Kristin shares that she encourages applicants who would likely make wonderful surrogates, but fall just outside of the ConceiveAbilities’ exceptionally high standards. “I believe in surrogacy in general and if a woman hears the calling to help another family but we are unable to work with her, for whatever reason, I am still cheering for her and hope she has the fulfilling experience I had.” The team encourages applicants to join the Surrogacy Learning Center to find out about changes they might be able to make to qualify as a surrogate and to discover additional ways of supporting hopeful people that want to become parents.

    "content": "According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, surrogacy has the highest rate of success of any fertility treatment. The CDC reports in vitro fertilization (IVF) with a donor egg has a success rate of 52%. Higher still is the rate of success with a surrogate. Fertility centers in the US have a surrogacy success rate of about 75% and that number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. Success is seen in the growth rate of surrogacy. The CDC reports that a gestational carrier was part of 5% of all embryo transfers in 2019, up from barely 1% a decade ago. Medical pioneer Dr. Brian Kaplan with Fertility Centers of Illinois has been passionately leading the way in infertility for nearly three decades in IVF, egg donation, gestational surrogacy and more. Dr. Kaplan joined our All Things Conceivable: A Podcast with Nazca Fontes to explain what this statistic means, and the context behind what it means both now and going forward, for intended parents and surrogates embarking on a surrogacy journey. Listen to the full podcast here, and you can hear firsthand what an honor it is to have Dr. Kaplan speaking with us. And read on for a summary of the key points made by Dr. Kaplan. Understanding the Reason For Surrogacy “There are very different couples and people who need surrogates and the results will vary depending on what the underlying reason is for doing surrogacy. In infertility, we have to have realistic expectations and they have to be set based on each, specific individualized story. The success rate of surrogacy is very dependent on what the reason for surrogacy is. Obviously, the uterus plays a role and the sperm, but the critical variable in getting pregnant is the egg. Women are born with their lifetime supply of eggs. With age, women lose their eggs; by the time they reach puberty, half their eggs are gone. By the time they reach menopause, all their eggs are gone. And, as women age, there is also reduction in egg quality. If an egg comes from a woman who’s in her forties, the success rate with surrogacy will not be 70%. It will be determined by the quality and age of the egg and subsequently the embryo. If the intended mother is 38, the success rate will be lower because the miscarriage rate will be higher. If an egg comes from a qualified egg donor, typically a younger woman, then the miscarriage rate is under 10% and the success rate ranges from 90 to 95%. It’s important to realize that each circumstance is unique and depends on many factors.” Surrogacy Success Rates for a Traditional Infertility Patient Using Donor Eggs And A Surrogate “The success rate with a patient using donor eggs and a surrogate will be the highest of all, because that is the ideal situation. You have relatively young eggs and therefore young embryos, so the implantation rates are very high and the miscarriage rates will be very low. If you use a surrogate who has a proven uterus that has been tested, you have a combination of the best of all worlds. That success rate can be well into the seventies and once they are pregnant, a 90 or 95% success rate. You have a normal uterus and embryos that are young from young eggs. That’s the ideal situation that provides the highest chance of a healthy baby.” Surrogacy Success Rates for Gay Men “The population of same sex male couples or gay men pursuing surrogacy to build their families is growing tremendously. The surrogacy process for gay men uses a donor egg together with a surrogate. In this case, the success rate of surrogacy goes up exponentially because now you have a young egg together with a proven uterus, or a proven surrogate. Now, your pregnancy success rates can be well into the seventies. So if it is a gay couple or male using surrogacy, the pregnancy rates are very high and can easily be around 70% for every embryo transfer. The success rates are the best of everything we do, but it is a commitment and I’m always humbled by that commitment.” What Is A Surrogate’s Role in the Success of A Surrogacy Journey? “Surrogates are women who are unique. Every time I meet one of these women, it is truly humbling that someone makes the decision to be a surrogate. They are contributing to giving life and that is really a very deep decision. There are surrogate requirements that a woman has to meet physically and emotionally. For me, age is not as critical because the uterus ages very little, as long as she’s proven to have had a healthy pregnancy. The surrogate will have to pass medical clearances and we do a whole battery of testing, both medically, genetically, and psychologically to make sure that she will have a safe and healthy surrogacy journey. I look at the surrogate’s history from an obstetrical point of view. If she’s had a strong history of pregnancy without complications, then she becomes ideal as a surrogate. It’s not a simple process. There’s a lot of education and there has to be a camaraderie and personal relationship between all of us, so everybody knows exactly what the expectation is. They have to trust who they are working with and that the legal system is all in place.” Read more about surrogate mother requirements. The Importance of the Best Surrogacy Team “The surrogacy team is very important. If you have a surrogacy agency that is incompetent, everything’s going to fall apart. If you’re looking for a less expensive way out, because it’s just cheap, that’s the result you’re going to get. This is life. You don’t want to take a chance with anything, whether it’s on the recruitment side, the legal side, or the medical side. You want those all optimized as much as science has available, even with its imperfections. And I think the collaboration between all of the parties is the key to a successful surrogacy journey. None of us can do this on our own. And I think why we get the success rates we do is a reflection of that collaboration. All physicians have different approaches and there are plenty of people who do a good job with surrogacy. We will have different styles, just like in art and music and everything else. And as a patient, you have to see someone you’re going to feel comfortable with in your heart, with your trust, and thinking you’re getting the best care. The approach some physicians have is a purely scientific approach. You base it on algorithms and that’s one approach to doing it. And it works very well and I respect that. I look at it a little differently. Of course what we do is science, but it’s also humanities. This is all about people. You have to get inside each other’s souls. You have to understand where they’re coming from, what their desires are, and what their dreams are.” What Is A Surrogacy Agency’s Role “Choosing a surrogacy agency that has earned a stellar reputation plays such a big role in a successful surrogacy journey. It’s not just the physician. Once the fertility physician gets patients to pregnancy, our care ends. We rely and we affiliate ourselves with the best agencies, like ConceiveAbilities, because we know that they are going to be taken care of all the way through their surrogacy journey. When you look at the complexity and enormity of a surrogacy journey, a patient should think about good standards of care, so that they don’t cut corners and they don’t take risks unnecessarily. It’s the same when you choose an IVF clinic as well. It’s very important to find someone with experience, so they know how to deal with many situations. My advice for intended parents and surrogates is to look for a surrogacy agency and ask a few questions. What is their reputation? How long have they been doing this? What kind of volume do they do? What kind of patients do they take care of? Can they provide service? Not just locally, but nationally. I wouldn’t look for the shortcut. I wouldn’t look for something that’s quick and easy because that’s where the problems occur.” Learn why surrogates and intended parents have been choosing ConceiveAbilities for 25 years and running. Medical Advances that Contribute to The Success of Surrogacy “The genetic advances have exploded and we’ll get more and more advanced in the ability to test for genetic disease before pregnancy. Artificial intelligence is the hot term that everybody’s talking about. I’m still not sure what role it plays in the fertility field, but it’s inevitable. At what pace and how we’ll utilize it is still unknown. Surrogacy is a growing part of our practice at fertility clinics. The population that needs a surrogate is growing as well. Today, surrogacy is broadly accepted. If you go to the schools today in all of the major metropolitan cities, a third of those children are born by working with surrogates, donor egg, donor sperm. There are single mothers, single fathers, gay parents. It’s such a heterogeneous group of how children are conceived. And at the end of the day, if you have children that are born as healthy as possible, that’s the bottom line. How we achieve that with technology is just a matter of individuals being comfortable. I think it will evolve where employers will realize how important it is and cover some of the expenses and costs with surrogacy. And I think all people should have an option to have children.” Calling All Surrogates And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy?

    "content": "If you’ve considered becoming a surrogate mother, you’ve likely done plenty of research about the medical procedures, compensation, legal contracts and more. But, you’re probably also wondering – how do I know if I’m a candidate for surrogacy? Dr. Angeline Beltsos, the CEO and Chief Medical Officer of Vios Fertility Institute, lays out the basic requirements, and why each requirement exists. These are some of the most frequently asked questions about what could disqualify a gestational carrier. Can I be a surrogate mother if I’ve never been pregnant? No. We do require that you have given birth to and we have this requirement for several reasons. Most importantly, it allows us to ensure that you’ve had a good medical experience with pregnancy and have enjoyed an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. Second, having already experienced pregnancy, we have great assurance that you have an idea of what you’re undertaking as a gestational carrier. Can I be a surrogate if I’m not married? Yes. Being married is not a requirement, but it is important to consider who will be your support system during the surrogacy journey. You will, of course, have your match manager readily available to answer questions and offer support, along with your Surrogate Sisterhood support group, but that only meets part of the need. From emotional support to everyday logistics such as childcare and housekeeping, it helps to have someone – perhaps a network of people – you can reliably depend on during the year or more of your surrogacy engagement. All gestational carriers, married or not, benefit from that support. Consider who those people are in your own life and how they might best be able to rally around you. Can I be a surrogate if I’m receiving government assistance? It depends. When you apply, we will talk with you to better understand your situation and provide our feedback.Certain assistance programs, such as supplemented childcare, are not disqualifying. You should, however, consider whether the compensation you receive as a surrogate will make you ineligible for certain support programs. Can I be a surrogate mother after tubal ligation? Yes. Because it does not impact your uterus, you can be a surrogate after a tubal ligation, sometimes referred to as getting your “tubes tied.” This form of permanent birth control will prevent you from getting pregnant naturally when an egg enters the fallopian tube to be fertilized. And because it is not your egg being used in a surrogate pregnancy, your fallopian tubes don’t need to function to become pregnant as a surrogate through In Vitro Fertilization. Can I be a surrogate at any age? Preferred candidates for surrogacy are between the ages of 21-39. Studies indicate this is the optimum age range for childbearing, meaning fewer complications and, typically, a faster recovery. Can I be a surrogate anywhere in the United States? Almost every state is a viable location from which to be a surrogate. Because surrogacy laws are not federally mandated and can vary from state to state (even county to county), however, not all states are favorable towards gestational surrogacy. Michigan, for example, forbids compensated surrogacy. Stay tuned, though, as the tide is turning quickly. New York just passed exciting, state-of-the-art legislation after a hard-fought battle. Several states, including New Jersey and Vermont, secured laws protecting surrogacy in 2018. What if I think I am disqualified to be a surrogate mother? If you think you are disqualified to be a surrogate, we still encourage you to apply to be a surrogate. Our team may be able to find a way for you to follow your dream of becoming a surrogate and, if you aren’t able to proceed, perhaps you have a friend that may qualify and your desire to help another family can be fulfilled by educating her.

    "content": "As Dr. Anate Brauer of Shady Grove Fertility shares, a surrogacy journey has many complexities. Working with professionals that have the right process, open communication, and experience is critical to having a successful outcome: a healthy baby home with its parents. Your embryo transfer is, no doubt, one of the most exciting steps in this challenging and complex process! Finally, after a lengthy period of screening and preparation, retrieval and fertilization, your embryos are ready to be transferred and will, hopefully, result in a successful pregnancy. But before you complete the embryo transfer process, there are 5 important things to know about those tiny cells. 1. It’s worth the wait. Typically, embryos are transferred between three to seven days after fertilization. During this waiting period, they are culturing in the lab and become blastocysts once they reach day 5 of development. While you may be feeling more than ready to move forward and have a transfer as soon as possible, it’s actually best to wait. The longer an embryo has to develop, the more likely the embryologist will be able to select the highest quality embryos to transfer. It also allows time for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) to screen for genetic abnormalities. A more viable blastocyst means a greater chance that the embryo transfers successfully. At day 5 of development, the uterine lining is typically the most receptive to an embryo that would just be leaving the fallopian tube. 2. Less is more. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) have the most widely-regarded criteria for embryo transfer precautions. They currently recommend single-embryo transfer (eSET), based on the following evidence: A multiple birth often results in more complications for the mother and babies SET in women under 38 years of age has no impact on live birth rates Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) helps determine the healthiest embryo to implant, resulting in a greater chance of pregnancy with just one embryo 3. Age may not be as crucial as we once thought. While there is no doubt that a woman’s fertility begins to decline in her early 30s, the clock may not need to tick quite as fast for IVF patients. The Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine (CCRM) recently conducted a research study to evaluate just how efficient a single embryo transfer would be for an IVF patient up to age 42. The stipulation: all were day 5 embryos that had undergone comprehensive chromosomal screening (CCS) to confirm chromosomal normality. The results: the rate of blastocyst aneuploidy, or presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, was vastly different – 62.4% in women between 38-42 versus 36.7% in the group 37 or younger. But as long as a chromosomally normal blastocyst was transferred, the live birth rates were almost identical: 60% in the advanced maternal age group and 64.6% in the younger group. “What the study says is that if you correct for aneuploidy, if you screen out embryos that are chromosomally abnormal, and you’re transferring a single embryo,” explains Dr. Schoolcraft, “the success really has no variance with age up to and including age 42.” It’s a far cry from previous IVF recommendations. Dr. Schoolcraft acknowledges, “If you look at SART and CDC data nationally, what you see is the opposite. There’s a profound decline in success rates around age 35 and it’s linear.” However, “What we’re saying is ‘yes, that’s true, because obviously you’re putting back more genetically lethal embryos as the patient is getting older. But if you take the same patient and screen out the abnormal embryos [with CCS] and you’re putting back a normal embryo, then up to age 42, age has no impact,” Dr. Schoolcraft explains. 4. Egg donation can maximize your chances. Still, age is just one of many factors when considering the embryo transfer success rate. While the prime age for an intended mother going through egg retrieval is 26-35 years old, utilizing an egg donor can increase your chances of building a family for other reasons too. Overall health should be considered, both lifestyle and family medical history. The donor must go through rigorous screening and monitoring to help ensure that any eggs retrieved are of optimum quality in order to create a healthy embryo. If you have unexplained infertility, a history of miscarriages, or have discovered genetic abnormalities, egg donation is a viable way to have a successful embryo transfer and, in turn, a healthy baby. 5. It’s just fine to freeze. Advancements in technique and technology have completely changed the landscape for freezing and preserving embryos. In the past, fresh transfers were the norm because it was difficult to keep an embryo viable beyond 3 days, much less safely freeze and then thaw them for later transfer. Today, frozen embryos have over a 95% successful thaw rate and the success rates of a fresh and frozen embryo transfer (FET) are nearly identical. One study actually showed that when the intended mother has a higher progesterone level, successful pregnancy rates were actually better with frozen embryos. All of this is great news for intended parents, who no longer need to stress about the often-complicated logistics of an IVF cycle and subsequent embryo transfer. And, it’s an especially promising finding for third-party reproduction. For intended parents that are working with an egg donor or gestational carrier, there is no need for additional coordination of cycles or schedules to complete the retrieval and fertilization. Embryos can be created at any time for future transfer. We are here to answer your questions about the best ways to navigate IVF.

    "content": "If you’ve finished building your family, it’s common to take more permanent measures to prevent pregnancy. From having an IUD inserted to surgical procedures like a tubal ligation or male vasectomy, there are plenty of options. But what if your situation changes? If you decide that you’d like to have another baby – whether it’s to add to your own family or to help someone else as a gestational surrogate – can you get pregnant after a tubal ligation? Read on for everything you need to know about conception and IVF after tubal ligation. What is tubal ligation? Tubal ligation, sometimes referred to as getting your “tubes tied,” is an interruption of the fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy. Typically, it involves the surgical removal of the middle section of the tubes. This requires about a week of light bed-rest, followed by a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) three months later to check the tubes. Using x-ray technology, HSG uses dye to show the flow from the uterus and fallopian tubes into the uterine cavity. This will confirm blockages that prevent pregnancy – which is, of course, the goal after a tubal ligation. Can you get pregnant if your tubes are tied? The chances are slim: about 1 in 1,000 after the first year and between 2-10 in 1,000 after 5 years. While most women can successfully have a tubal ligation, reversal so that you can intentionally become pregnant is not a guarantee. It requires enough healthy tissue on both ends of the tube for it to reconnect and open all the way through to function properly. Even then, 20% of women will have so much scar tissue that the flow of the tube is blocked. HSG is done again after a reversal to check for proper flow. There is also a greater risk for ectopic pregnancy after a tubal reversal. Typically, a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus; in an ectopic pregnancy, it most often attaches in the fallopian tube. The pregnancy cannot proceed normally, and if left untreated it can be life threatening. After a tubal reversal, the risk for an ectopic pregnancy is about 10 to 20 percent. So how likely is it to get pregnant after a tubal ligation? Ultimately, the success rate for pregnancy following a tubal reversal is about 40 percent in women under 37. Pregnancy Options After Tubal Ligation A great option to pursue pregnancy following a tubal ligation is through in vitro fertilization (IVF); in fact, the process is not any more complicated to do with your tubes tied. In natural conception, the egg must travel through the fallopian tube to be fertilized by sperm. With IVF, pregnancy can occur bypassing the fallopian tubes all together. It gives patients a higher chance of pregnancy in the shortest amount of time without having a significant surgical procedure. If you don’t want to have another tubal ligation after the pregnancy or deal with another method of birth control long term, it can be a great solution. Another pressing question about tubal ligation and fertility treatment: does insurance cover IVF after tubal ligation? In most cases, no. Unfortunately, insurance doesn’t cover IVF under any circumstance in many states. It’s something to investigate with your carrier, but many will not cover IVF after a voluntary tubal ligation. Can you be a surrogate after tubal ligation? Yes! It could actually mean you’re a great candidate for surrogacy; you have proven fertility and are most likely done building your own family, both of which are important qualities for a gestational carrier. Plus – and this is also a critical point – it’s extremely unlikely you’ll become pregnant on your own before the embryo transfer. Because the egg will be from the intended mother or an egg donor, your ovaries and fallopian tubes will not be involved in the process at all. Be a surrogate As Dr. Channing Burks Chatmon, a Reproductive Endocrinologist with Fertility Centers of Illinois explains, professionals are available to help you through these and many other issues related to family building. Calling All Surrogates And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy?

    "content": "Dr. Tomer Singer, with Shady Grove Fertility New York and an award-winning physician, explains why people need to use a surrogate. Whether they have had a medical issue, like a hysterectomy or cancer, have had multiple miscarriages or are a same sex couple, surrogacy allows all people who want to become parents build a family. Role Models for Surrogacy: Everyday Moms and Dads Who Worked With Surrogates As with the advancement of any progressive social ideal, the stories of every day families are the best way to spread the word. Some fantastic surrogate-assisted families from California to Boston recently shared their stories with VeryWell Family, including our very own Crystal Patel. Why is surrogacy becoming so popular? Six Reasons to Consider a Surrogate Mother There are many reasons why hopeful parents might choose to take the route of having a baby through a surrogate mother; here are just six of the most common: Age: Women’s fertility and ability to have a successful pregnancy declines with age. The good news is that a surrogate, in addition to having had a successful prior delivery of her own child, will be the right age to carry a successful pregnancy to term. The age range requirement when accepting surrogates or gestational carriers is generally from 21-39 years old. Lack of a Uterus: The woman in a couple wishing to start a family may not have a uterus. This can be the result of a rare genetic malformation affecting as many as one in twelve thousand women, or the woman may have had her uterus removed. This is sometimes a necessary step in treating certain forms of cancer. The lack of a uterus precludes any possibility of the woman bearing a child herself. Same-Sex Couples: Gay couples, most commonly men, will sometimes use donated eggs and the services of a surrogate mother to create a family. At ConceiveAbilities, we are delighted to report that this practice is rapidly gaining in widespread public acceptance, as well as being long validated by the medical community. For more information on the subject, please check out our information on same sex parenting. Uterine Structural Problem: Less severe than the above, a woman might have an inherent condition or uterine defect that makes conception of a child difficult. Alternatively, a malformation of the uterus can have little impact on conception but can make it impossible for the woman to carry her child to term safely. Other Medical Conditions: Some medical conditions, while they don’t directly affect a woman’s physical ability to bear children, can have an impact upon her ability to carry a healthy child to term – particularly while maintaining her own health at the same time. Conditions such as heart disease, kidney disease, or severe diabetes can turn a pregnancy into a life-threatening event for mother and child alike, as might a history of certain types of cancer. Also, certain medicines being taken to treat an unrelated health problem or physical condition may put an unborn child’s health at risk. Personal Decision: As modern family advocates, we believe everyone has the right to build families in the way that supports their personal choices. For some women, surrogacy is not a medical choice, but a social choice. Naturally, there are many other reasons for deciding to have a child by working with a surrogate mother, but these six options alone represent the reasons for tens of thousands of couples in dozens of countries around the world – people who could see their dream of a biological child made reality by means of surrogacy. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate?

    "content": "Family building opportunities have come a long way and surrogacy is fast growing option. With that growth comes the awareness of surrogacy as a very special means of creating a family – but it can also leave room for confusion. To help set the record straight, we asked Dr. Daniel Shapiro, Medical Director of Reproductive Biology Associates, to explain the difference between gestational carriers and other types of surrogacy. Watch his clear explanation, and read on to understand more. What is a gestational carrier? The most common form of modern surrogacy is achieved with a gestational carrier. This is a woman who undergoes in vitro fertilization and carries an embryo that was created with the intended mother or donor’s egg and the intended father or donor’s sperm. The gestational carrier is not genetically related to the child. Because gestational surrogacy does not involve a genetic link between the surrogate and the baby, it has become a safe and popular means of starting or growing a family. What is a traditional surrogate? A traditional surrogate, on the other hand, is the biological mother, while the gestational carrier is not. This typically means the embryo is creating using the surrogate’s eggs and, perhaps, Intrauterine Insemination (“IUI”) using the father or sperm donor’s sperm. It is not recommended to attempt a pregnancy with a surrogate using her own eggs due to the underlying emotional and legal implications. If the surrogate is also the biological mother, there is a greater risk to all parties. For instance, she could have legal grounds to challenge custody or could, conversely, be left with medical and financial responsibility for the baby. Some clinics are not comfortable managing traditional surrogacy arrangements, and in many locations, traditional surrogacy is completely outlawed. The Gestational Surrogacy Process After a series of medical screenings, the gestational surrogacy process begins by preparing for implantation. To harvest embryos for the surrogacy journey, the intended mother or egg donor undergoes an egg retrieval. Embryos are created using these eggs and the intended father or donor’s sperm and then then transferred to the gestational carrier’s uterus. Anyone considering how to become a surrogate mother must have a solid understanding of the surrogacy journey. She must be fully educated on what is involved, both medically and legally, and have a solid support system throughout this unique commitment. Surrogacy and the Law Surrogacy laws in the United States can vary widely from state to state and are always evolving. In states where surrogacy is not supported or the law is unclear, intended parents may have to go through an adoption process to gain custody of the child. In other states, pre-birth orders called “declaration of parentage” allow intended parents to be declared the legal parents, even prior to their baby’s birth. It is imperative that all contracts and agreements are drafted by lawyers with deep experience in third party reproduction and reproductive rights. The surrogacy process is complex but can be a rewarding experience – even a miracle – for everyone involved. Join our Surrogacy Learning Center to continue the conversation and learn more.

Surrogacy is the most successful treatment for infertility, with a 75% success rate. That number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. ConceiveAbilities has been helping hopeful people build their families by working with surrogate mothers and egg donors for 25 years, a time during which assisted reproductive technology has gone through a revolution. And, we’ve learned so much during that time as we’ve witnessed an entire generation of families come into being. We are invested in providing expert information needed to embark on a successful surrogacy journey.

Why Does Someone Become a Surrogate? How Do Surrogates Find Intended Parents? How do Surrogates Prepare for a Successful Surrogacy Journey? How Does Surrogacy Differ from One Part of the Country to Another? What is Surrogacy? Surrogacy is a modern and growing means of bringing new life into the world, where a woman carries a baby for another person or a couple. The intended parents undergo IVF meaning fertilization outside of the body, to transfer their embryo into the surrogate’s uterus. In our work at ConceiveAbilities, surrogates are not genetically or legally related to the baby and are compensated for their time and service by the intended parents. In 2019, more than 17,000 births took place by surrogate in the United States and the market is steadily growing at 15% per year based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And, in the past ten years, the percentage of all IVF transfers that took place with a gestational carrier grew more than 5-fold, from just over 1% to 5.4%. A surrogate, or gestational carrier, is a woman who carries a baby for an individual or a couple that has no genetic relationship to her. The person who is trying to have a baby with the help of the surrogate is known as an intended parent. At ConceiveAbilities, we work with intended parents who undergo IVF so that the surrogate can carry a baby to whom she is not genetically or legally related. The surrogate is paid for her time and efforts by the intended parent(s). The embryo is created from the intended father’s sperm, or donor sperm, and the intended mother’s egg, or donor egg. When the baby is born, the intended parents are listed on the birth certificate as the legal parents and assume all responsibility for the child. Founder and CEO, Nazca Fontes, shared ConceiveAbilities expert knowledge of the surrogacy process with Healthline for their article What Is Gestational Surrogacy. People often misunderstand what a gestational carrier, or surrogate, is. Today, in a modern surrogacy journey, a gestational surrogate has no genetic relation to the baby she is carrying for another person. In prior times, however, a traditional surrogate used her egg and also carried the baby for the intended family. Dr. Daniel Shapiro of Reproductive Biology Associates further explains the difference between a traditional vs gestational surrogate. To understand surrogacy success rates is to understand how and why surrogacy is the best chance in making a dream of a family come true. This data helps potential surrogate mothers have confidence that their time and commitment to helping a family is highly likely to have a joyous outcome. Learn more about how surrogacy works and why it’s the most successful fertility treatment. Why Does Someone Need a Surrogate? There are many reasons people choose surrogacy to make their dream of a family come true including infertility, medical reasons, and men who don’t have a uterus. Some women have medical reasons like our intended mother Kelly Cesare who had a heart transplant and survived cancer. She shared her story in the New York Post article Surrogacy Legal in NY: What This Means For New Yorkers. Intended parent Ashley Katzen shared her fertility journey and how she decided to use a surrogate to build her family in An Intended Parent’s Surrogacy Journey. And ConceiveAbilities Intended Families, Crystal Patel & Kunal Mody and Randy Rowe & Kyle Keigan shared their surrogacy journey with VeryWell Family. Between 10-20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. According to the March of Dimes, that number may be as high as 50% when we take into account pregnancies ending before a woman misses a menstrual cycle. Intended parent, Lara Beth Levy, shared how she and her husband chose to use a surrogate after suffering miscarriages with the NY Post. Not all surrogacy journeys begin with an infertility diagnosis. Some choose surrogacy for personal reasons. Surrogacy is also a highly successful option for the LGBTQ+ community and single men to become parents. Listen to A Single Dad’s Surrogacy Journey with Joseph Tito of The Dad Diaries to hear how Joseph, a single gay dad, became a father through his surrogacy journey. Learn more about the people a woman can help by becoming a surrogate in Six Reasons to Use a Surrogate Mother. Surrogates are so very needed and treasured to grow families. Learn more about all the reasons families and couples use a surrogate. What is Infertility? Infertility is defined as a disease, condition, or status characterized by the need for medical intervention, including, but not limited to, the use of donor gametes or donor embryos in order to achieve a successful pregnancy either as an individual or with a partner and is inclusive of LGBTQ+ and single communities. In patients having regular, unprotected intercourse and without any known etiology for either partner suggestive of impaired reproductive ability, evaluation should be initiated at 12 months when the female partner is under 35 years of age and at six months when the female partner is 35 years of age or older. Infertility affects 6.7 million women in the U.S., about 11% of the population’s reproductive-age population. It’s estimated that 1 in 8 couples (or 12% of married women) has trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy. Fertility declines as people age. A couple of ages 29-33 with a normal functioning reproductive system has only a 20-25% chance of conceiving in any month. After six months of trying, 60% of couples will conceive without medical assistance. Approximately one-third of infertility is attributed to the female partner, one-third to the male partner, and one-third is caused by a combination of problems in both partners or is unexplained. What causes infertility? There is a wide range of potential sources. For instance, one cause of female infertility is something called hostile cervical mucus, often referred to as a hostile uterus. Hashimoto’s disease is also linked to infertility and can make getting pregnant more difficult. That’s because decreased levels of thyroid hormone interfere with ovulation. Another cause of female infertility has to do with a hormone called prolactin. When levels of prolactin are high, it can be an indicator of deeper hormonal issues and, potentially, lead to infertility. Learn more about infertility and how it affects 1 in 8 couples. What Are Infertility Treatments? Some women seek infertility treatment using medicines like Letrozole to induce ovulation and improve endometrial thickness. Since Letrozole only addresses ovulation, it doesn’t impact other potential root causes of infertility. 40% of female infertility is related to tubal factor infertility. In order to get an official diagnosis, doctors may perform an hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test, a procedure that can help diagnose tubal occlusion or obstruction, as well as uterine malformations, pelvic inflammatory disease, and Asherman’s syndrome. Once confirmed, women may have a clearer understanding of the next steps to take in order to build their family. Couples that are pursuing infertility treatments may live on an emotional roller coaster, as each pregnancy attempt is high stakes. They learn the difference between a viable and non-viable pregnancy and, while a couple who suffers from a non-viable pregnancy may well find future success, repeated setbacks may lead the couple to consider a different path to build their family. Learn more about what are infertility treatments. How Do Intended Parents Find a Surrogate? A surrogacy journey requires a large team of professionals to reach the end goal of having a child. Finding the right surrogate to partner with can make all the difference in a successful surrogacy journey. Some intended parents choose to source their own surrogates and find themselves in a partnership that isn’t what they expected. A team of professionals is essential to find a surrogate who has shared values and expectations. A surrogacy journey is a deeply personal journey for both the intended parent and surrogate. ConceiveAbilities properly vets potential surrogates to ensure she is both physically and emotionally prepared to embark on a safe and healthy surrogacy journey. Because of our diligence, 95% of our surrogates pass fertility clinic medical clearance, saving loss of precious time and potential heartache of not being able to continue a surrogacy journey. Often, when people source their own surrogate, they are not prepared for the legal expertise and time it takes to manage a journey. ConceiveAbilities guides both parties through creating a legal contract outlining the surrogacy journey. Additionally, surrogacy laws are complex and differ from state to state and sometimes even county to county and can lead to difficult and expensive parentage and unnecessary stress in a time that should be joyous. A surrogacy journey is longer than a natural pregnancy. ConceiveAbilities ensures that intended parents and surrogates alike are educated and emotionally prepared for a longer journey. Your roadmap, built for you, is rooted in 25 years of experience in navigating clinic-by-clinic (and doctor-by-doctor) requirements for surrogate qualifications, state-by-state (and county-by-county) requirements for securing parentage, relationship dynamics between intended parents and gestational carriers in making important decisions, and the unique ups-and-downs that every surrogacy journey presents. ConceiveAbilities provides expertise in every facet of the journey to support your successful process, such as in-house mental health professionals, to the joyful outcome we all strive for: a healthy baby home with its parents. Learn more about success stories with ConceiveAbilities and how we match intended parents with the perfect surrogate. Why Does Someone Become a Surrogate? For many people, their path to parenthood has been challenging. Knowing that surrogacy gives them the best chance to hold their baby in their arms is remarkable. As more people turn to surrogacy, more women are finding themselves called to surrogacy. Why? ConceiveAbilities recently hired research firm Accelerant Research to better understand surrogates. The firm surveyed 100 surrogates, more than 500 qualified surrogacy prospects and more than 1,000 women from the general population. Of the surrogates and qualified surrogacy prospects, Accelerant found: More than half volunteer regularly Nearly half are registered blood and organ donors Almost one-quarter of them foster pets More than three-quarters said they did so because they knew someone personally in need Two-thirds said they had first-hand exposure to a relative or close friend’s struggle with weighing the infertility “We found that the single biggest motivation for surrogates is the simple desire to help,” Nazca Fontes, CEO of ConceiveAbilities shared. “Eighty-seven percent said they find joy in helping others; 74 percent reported they are motivated by a sense of empowerment as a surrogate.” Other driving factors include that 78 percent of these women know someone in need and 68 percent want to support the LGBTQ community. Deciding to become a surrogate is a deeply personal and courageous decision. There is a lot of information about surrogacy to research. Listen to our podcast Busting Surrogacy Myths with OB-GYN Dr. Heather Carlson who explains the facts of surrogacy and dispels some surrogate misconceptions. One of the biggest surrogacy myths is that the surrogate is genetically related to the baby. ConceiveAbilities surrogates have no genetic relationship to the intended parent(s)’ child. It is important to understand the process of gestational surrogacy and the motivation behind why women want to become a surrogate. A woman thinking about becoming a surrogate may want to know what could disqualify her in the surrogate application process. Our team is always on hand to answer any questions and provide support throughout the process of learning about surrogacy. For women considering becoming a surrogate, the best resource we can provide is personal experience. Many of our surrogates have volunteered to be advocates to speak directly with women thinking about being a surrogate. Our surrogates’ stories have also been featured in their local news including: Andrea Brenes in Miami Mom Collective’s One Amazing Mama Shares Why She Became a Surrogate, Kristi Graves in How To Become a Surrogate in Denver and Briana Buck in Charlotte Mom of Two Earns $52,000 As A Surrogate. Learn more about what inspires women to become a surrogate, factors that play into her decision to give the gift of family and what matters most to her throughout her surrogacy journey in How To Decide To Become A Surrogate Mother. What are the requirements to be a surrogate? The most important requirements are quite basic: she must have given birth before and she must be a US citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Check out Surrogate Medical Requirements FAQs to review the basic qualifications and find answers to frequently asked questions about becoming a surrogate. The Age Limit for Surrogate Mothers outlines why age is such an important factor in becoming a surrogate. Many women also want to know if they can become a surrogate after a tubal ligation. Find out why having a tubal ligation can actually be advantageous for a woman in a surrogacy journey. We encourage all women who feel they have been called to become a surrogate to learn about the full process of How To Become A Surrogate Mother. Learn more about why does someone become a surrogate. How Do Surrogates Find Intended Parents? Choosing the right surrogacy agency provides a surrogate with proper compensation, legal and financial support, and protection throughout their surrogacy journey. Partnering with an experienced surrogate agency prevents a surrogate from experiencing hardships and pitfalls that can occur in a surrogacy journey, especially when a surrogate is choosing to partner with the family she was meant to help. Matching with the right family is a top priority for a surrogate. A surrogate is a partner in the surrogacy process. Through our Matching Matters™, ConceiveAbilities takes into consideration personal preferences to help pair a surrogate with the perfect family for her that has shared expectations and values. A surrogate is bravely giving the gift of family and should be focused on what matters most, taking care of herself and her family while carrying the baby. ConceiveAbilities allows surrogates to do that by having a surrogate process in place. Without an agency, much of the paperwork, communication and arrangements fall to the surrogate and are time consuming. ConceiveAbilities ensures a surrogate’s needs are protected. Financially, our surrogacy agency vets and creates financial assurance to secure surrogate compensation and all the resources needed for the surrogacy journey to be a successful one. We provide legal guidance to make sure a surrogate’s rights are met throughout every step of the surrogacy journey. Our agency ensures a surrogate has proper health insurance, medical coverage and life insurance, is fairly compensated, legally protected, and physically and mentally supported throughout every step of a surrogacy journey.

Understanding the surrogacy process is important for a successful journey. There are many myths and misconceptions about surrogacy, including Does a Surrogate Mother Share DNA with the Baby? and Do Surrogates Get Attached To The Baby? Dispelling myths and researching concerns is important to feel comfortable through every step of the surrogacy process. In addition to researching the process of surrogacy, intended parents need a plan to pay for a surrogacy journey. At the outset, that may seem straightforward but it requires a thorough understanding of the full cost of surrogacy. Our All-In Program for intended parents, a first-of-its-kind offering, leverages our 25 years of experience to offer the most comprehensive and risk-free surrogacy program in the market. One of the more important decisions for intended parents is how to create embryos. For instance, an intended mother can choose to harvest her own eggs even after a hysterectomy. Many hopeful parents will need to find a great egg donor. ConceiveAbilities is a pioneer in the egg donor business and has grown into a full family fertility agency by always putting the security of intended parents and egg donors first. From application through retrieval, we make sure each party has the egg donor information needed, including the egg donation timeline, so each party is as informed and empowered as possible.

    "content": "What You Need To Know About COVID-19 and Pregnancy Pregnancy and the COVID-19 vaccination is a hot topic in our fertility world today. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for people age16 and older. The CDC encourages all pregnant people or people who are thinking about becoming pregnant and those breastfeeding to get vaccinated to protect themselves from COVID-19. And the American Society for Reproductive Medicine says while all women should be strongly encouraged to receive COVID-19 vaccination when pregnant or attempting pregnancy, clinics should strongly consider requiring vaccination for gestational carriers and advise intended parents to include the requirement of vaccination of gestational carriers in their contracts. How do you take all of that information and apply it to pregnancy and surrogacy? As we navigate the pandemic and new variants, we’ve been hearing a lot about the questions and concerns from all parties regarding how that impacts surrogates and our intended parents. Dr. Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron, board certified in both Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, with Fertility Centers of Illinois answered our questions about the COVID-19 vaccine and surrogacy on our podcast All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes. Here are our top seven takeaways about COVID-19 and pregnancy from our interview with Dr. Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron. 1: Pregnancy is a risk factor for COVID-19 “Some data has demonstrated increased risk of ICU stays, increased risk of miscarriage, and increased risk of stillbirth. So the virus itself can particularly impact the health of a pregnant woman, which makes it even more pertinent to discuss ways to prevent pregnant women from getting COVID.” 2: Pregnant women are protected by the vaccine “Even with the Delta variant, when you’ve been vaccinated, the risk of hospitalization is still quite low. It’s a pandemic of the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated individuals are the ones getting sick enough that they’re being hospitalized. And the vaccine is the tool we have to prevent it.” 3: The vaccine is >95% effective “Some people who got vaccinated, but still had a positive COVID test, may be frustrated. But if someone’s at home with a cold, that’s not what we’re really worried about. What we’re really worried about is someone being hospitalized or being in the ICU.” 4: The COVID-19 vaccine is safe “About 22 healthcare organizations have supported the vaccine including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and the CDC. As more studies are done and the data accumulates, we’ve become more and more reassured that they continue to support the safety of the vaccine. They do not increase your risk of infertility. They do not worsen the pregnancy. They protect the pregnancy, because the virus is a risk to your pregnancy.” 5: Doctors recommend the COVID-19 vaccination “Our job is to educate people that just like quitting smoking, obtaining a healthy weight, or limiting alcohol, the vaccine is a way that we are making your body as healthy as possible to receive a pregnancy, whether it’s for a “keeper” baby or not.” 6: The vaccine is strongly recommended for surrogates “On a case by case, physicians will approve or discourage a surrogate based on their vaccination status. I can only speak for myself, but I would gather that the vast majority of Reproductive Endocrinologists are going to discourage surrogates that are uncomfortable with the vaccine.” 7: Make your health optimal for a surrogacy journey “It is an incredible gift to consider being a surrogate. I don’t want to minimize it for one second and to now take that next step to say, what can I proactively do to make my health optimal in this pandemic and the pregnancy optimal. The vaccine is in that category. I implore everyone out there who’s concerned about safety to ask their physician. Ask them to review the data. Ask them pointedly the questions and the concerns that you personally have and use good information to make a good decision.” A Note from our CEO and Founder “When surrogates come to the decision to embark on a surrogacy journey, they’re helping families that have been through struggle, after struggle, after struggle. And what they’re looking for more than anything is to partner with a like-minded surrogate who gives them the best, healthiest chance for creating the family of their dreams and for that healthy baby. Rarely do I take such an extreme stance on a topic in these podcasts, but the physicians here are the experts. Consider the risks for you and the baby that you may be carrying or will be caring for an intended parent and put your best foot forward on behalf of that family, so that they can have their dreams fulfilled and you can be safe. Roll up your sleeves and get that vaccination.”Nazca Fontes Why Must Surrogates With ConceiveAbilities Be Vaccinated Against COVID-19 As your surrogacy agency, your health and well being is our top priority. We are here to help you navigate your surrogacy journey in every way possible. COVID-19 presents significant risks to surrogates and babies and puts intended parents’ dreams of a family in jeopardy. Following reputable medical recommendations for standard of care for pregnant women and our fertility clinic medical partners’ protocol, surrogates with ConceiveAbilities must be vaccinated to embark on a surrogacy journey. Many of our fertility clinics are following these recommendations and will not clear an unvaccinated surrogate to move forward in a surrogacy journey. This is time and effort lost for you and the intended parents if concerns about COVID-19 vaccination ultimately end in a failed surrogacy journey. We know that for you to move forward in a timely, healthy and productive manner, you will need to be vaccinated. Medical and life insurance companies are not insuring unvaccinated surrogates for illness and deaths associated with COVID-19, putting you and your family’s well being at risk. Gestational carriers who are unvaccinated are not only risking their own health, but are significantly risking the health of the intended parents’ child. While we respect the autonomy of people to make decisions regarding their own health, the gestational carrier has a unique status as the child they are carrying is not their own and not being vaccinated puts someone else’s child at risk. We acknowledge vaccination may not be the path forward for you and thank you for considering becoming a surrogate with ConceiveAbilities. The best way to get information about the COVID-19 vaccine is to talk with your doctor. There are many resources available to help answer your questions and prepare you to ask more questions of your doctor including a recent study of more than 17,000 pregnant women. We stand ready to assist you. Are you a woman who was enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate? Talk to us to learn more about the possibilities to help someone else’s dream come true.

    "content": "For a surrogate, her surrogacy pregnancy is different from her other pregnancies and will most likely be her first experience with the IVF process. At ConceiveAbilities, our Life Simplicity Promise ensures each surrogate fully understands the IVF process and is comfortable with every step. Medically, a surrogate goes through the same steps as any woman who undergoes IVF treatment. Because the embryo has no genetic relation to the surrogate, it is implanted in her womb through the IVF process and her body needs to be prepared for implantation by taking medications and hormones like progesterone and estrogen to prepare her body for the embryo transfer. The fertility clinic will provide direction on the surrogate’s specific medication protocol, such as hormone injections, and it will vary from one fertility clinic to another. Watch Fertility Expert Dr. Mark Leondires of the Illume Fertility Clinic explain the embryo transfer process. STEPS FROM MATCH TO EMBRYO TRANSFER As your surrogacy agency, ConceiveAbilities will guide you through every step of your journey. Our team will collaborate with your fertility clinic to ensure all steps are completed. The below checklist will help you keep track of your progress. Please also refer to email communications for more details on each step and do not hesitate to reach out to your team with any questions along the way. Once you are matched, you will complete the financial and medical work necessary to. This included obtaining medical clearance from the fertility clinic, getting the proper insurance in place and completing your gestational carrier agreement. When all of the medical, financial and legal paperwork is complete, you will be cleared for embryo transfer. You will then begin the surrogate IVF process to prepare your body for a surrogate pregnancy. What is the IVF process step by step? After you are cleared for embryo transfer, the fertility clinic will establish a treatment plan and medical protocol detailed and specific to you. Remember, each clinic and each IVF cycle can be different, but this is an example of what an IVF calendar may look like: Step 1: For the first three weeks, many women take birth control to regulate hormone levels and to synchronize her menstrual cycle so that the timing is aligned with the medical protocol. Step 2: The day the woman gets her period is an important step in the IVF process. She will continue to take birth control pills to maintain the regulation of hormones. Step 3: On day 21, she may begin taking medications such as Lupron that will mimic natural ovulation. Step 4: After taking medication for 10 days, she will have an appointment to ensure ovulation has been suppressed. Step 5: She will begin taking medications to grow the lining of the uterus and to help her body prepare for a successful embryo transfer. While the specific approach varies and is customized to each gestational carrier provided by the fertility clinic. Step 6: The embryo transfer! The highest quality embryo that is available to the intended parents is transferred to the gestational carrier to attempt a pregnancy. A pregnancy test can be attempted about two weeks after the transfer. Fertility clinic provides a calendar/protocol specific to the surrogate. ConceiveAbilities sets up local monitoring clinic. Intended Parents contact local monitoring clinic to provide payment information (if 2021 or 2022 All In) Surrogate contacts local monitoring clinic to schedule appointments. ConceiveAbilities will assist with booking surrogate’s travel as needed for the embryo transfer. How long does the IVF process from start to finish? Most frequently, surrogates are on a medication regime for 10-12 weeks. With our All-In Surrogate Care and Compensation Package, she receives comprehensive support from a team of experts. There can be unforeseen circumstances in which the stimulation process takes a bit longer, or may even need to be canceled and restarted the next month if the ovaries are over or under responding to the medical protocol. While your clinic can estimate a general timeframe and will create a calendar for you to follow, it’s important to maintain flexibility, follow instructions precisely, and remember that each cycle is unique.

We know it is a big decision and we value your commitment to help another family achieve their dream of having a child. Surrogates sit at the heart of our program and your health and safety is our top priority. As your surrogacy agency, we are fully invested in your physical and mental health from the beginning of your surrogacy journey through your fourth trimester recovery. Our All-In Surrogate Care & Compensation Package prepares you for a successful surrogacy pregnancy and supports you throughout your journey until you recover. Our comprehensive plan to ensure a successful Fourth Trimester recovery, from the start of your pregnancy and based on The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists standard of care, including Birth preparation and doula care Physical therapy Nutrition Fitness and movement An important part of being prepared for a successful surrogacy pregnancy is being prepared for recovery. After you have delivered the precious baby for your intended family, you will need to recover. OB-GYN and Medical Officer of Women’s Health for the Philadelphia Department of Health, Dr. Aasta Mehta is a proponent of The Fourth Trimester, the period of about 12 weeks after a woman gives birth. While there is no magical number of weeks a woman takes to recover from delivery, Dr. Mehta emphatically says 12 weeks is not enough in our interview The Importance of Fourth Trimester Care with Dr. Aasta Mehta. Three Key Points For Surrogates Planning For Their Fourth Trimester Dr. Mehta answered our questions about the importance of the fourth trimester on our All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes. You can listen to The Full Fourth Trimester Podcast here. 1: Set The Stage For A Strong Fourth Trimester Recovery “You’re never going to be able to predict the hormonal imbalance and how that will impact your mental and physical health, but you should be as prepared as possible. Having a support network in place and having a postpartum plan, such as who’s going to care for the baby at night or during the day if you need a mental health break, is helpful. There are postpartum plans you can find on Google and work with your doctor to decide on a feasible plan for you and your family. A lactation expert, mental health professionals, and pelvic floor physical therapy are just a few who can offer great support. Postpartum doulas can also be a really great support after delivery.” 2: How Does A Surrogate’s Recovery Differ From Her Other Pregnancies? “Some of the stresses of that postpartum fourth trimester do have to do with caring for a child and the emotional impact of that. But certainly, the physiology also lends itself to the surrogate. The difference in emotions and depression is physiological, regardless of not being the care-taker of the child after birth. So that’s something to understand and not feel like, wait, but I don’t even have the baby, why am I depressed? That is a message that I want people to hear, because your hormones are completely changed after birth. I think it is important to recognize that even though you were going into this birth experience knowing this was not your baby, that feeling of emptiness might still be there. Regardless of how prepared you are, that potentially could have an impact and having those supports in place to deal with those types of feelings is important. These feelings are normal and a surrogate should not feel embarrassed if she feels that way. For everyone, not just surrogates, complications can occur in that postpartum period that can lead to cardiovascular conditions like cardiomyopathy and embolism. These things can mimic normal changes in the postpartum period. Being really in tune with your body and what you are feeling and knowing what’s normal and what’s not can make the difference. It’s also helpful to have people around you looking out for you as well. I imagine in surrogacy, your family’s not helping as much, because you don’t need help with a baby. But I think having those loved ones looking out for specific medical complications that could occur, can help.” 3: What Do You Want Women To Know About The Fourth Trimester “Don’t ignore your own health for the benefit of your baby, because you’re only doing harm that way. There’s no actual roadmap for what’s the right way to recover after childbirth. It’s whatever is the right way for you. There’s no time frame on that. It’s okay to feel like you are struggling and to know you can ask for help.” Steps You Can Take To Educate Yourself Below, we’ve outlined some steps you can take to make sure your surrogate pregnancy is a successful one.

We have a great blog from a surrogate husband’s perspective My Wife Is A Surrogate and resources here about the men behind surrogacy that can help you start the conversation. For explaining surrogacy to your children, The Kangaroo Pouch written by Dianne Whitfield is a fantastic book. Maintain a balanced and healthy diet A surrogacy pregnancy is, in some sense, like any other traditional pregnancy: it requires you to look after your body and it’s never too soon to start those habits. To start, Healthy Lifestyle Diet Suggestions For Surrogate Mothers is a good resource. Remove sources of stress Finally, as a surrogate mother, you have the responsibility to create a relaxed and stress-free environment for the child you are carrying. In fact, research shows that stress affects the child’s brain development, so this is a great opportunity to think creatively about about how to lessen stressors in your life. Surrogacy can be a beautiful journey, however, for many first-time surrogates, the uncertainty of the process is a usual source of concern.

    "content": "We are honored whenever a woman chooses to talk with us about becoming a surrogate. And, we have many safeguards in place to help ensure that surrogacy can be a healthy and successful experience for both the surrogate and the baby. During our screening process, ConceiveAbilities takes a holistic approach to all considerations and puts significant investment into a surrogate’s medical and obstetrical history with review by registered nurses. Why does this help our surrogate applicants? 95% of our surrogates are medically cleared by their intended parents’ fertility center, ensuring that we safeguard your time, efforts, and emotions. What are the specific surrogate medical requirements? There are several basic qualifications we first consider when we screen surrogates. The primary requirements to become a surrogate include a “yes” answer to each of these questions: Have you given birth to at least one child? Are you between the ages of 21 to 39 years old? Is your BMI lower than 35, and ideally lower than 30? Did you have uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries? Are you a non-smoker? Do you have stable mental health, with no bouts of severe anxiety or depression? As part of surrogacy process, you will also undergo a medical screening with a fertility specialist to make sure that you able to sustain a pregnancy. All of the records for your previous pregnancies will be reviewed to ensure they were healthy and uncomplicated. You should be upfront about any experiences with preterm labor or miscarriage when applying to become a surrogate. Can I become a surrogate without a previous pregnancy? No. It is a strict requirement that surrogates have carried at least one of their own children to term in a healthy pregnancy. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine includes this in their guidelines for surrogacy and it will be a requirement with any reputable surrogacy agency, fertility clinic, and reproductive endocrinologist. What medical conditions can disqualify you to be a surrogate mother? ConceiveAbilities will do a thorough review of your medical and obstetrical history, conducted by registered nurses, to ensure a surrogacy journey can be healthy and successful for you, along with the baby you would carry. We consider everything from the health of your heart, to the health of your reproductive organs, to the health of your endocrine system, and more. Agencies, and the fertility clinics they work with, can vary in what medical conditions disqualify a surrogate applicant. Your doctor is also a valuable resource to advise you on your specific circumstances. With that said, there are several conditions which may disqualify you from becoming a surrogate mother. HIV can be transmitted to the baby during pregnancy or birth, so surrogates cannot test positive for HIV. Preeclampsia in previous pregnancies leads to a higher likelihood in later pregnancies. The high blood pressure and kidney damage that come with preeclampsia present a health risk to the surrogate and the baby. Ablation destroys a part of your uterine lining, which makes a successful implantation more unlikely. It also increases the risk of miscarriage if you do become pregnant and will disqualify you from becoming a surrogate. PCOS impacts the likelihood of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and other health risks which can impact your ability to carry a baby. Your doctor can best determine the impacts of PCOS on a potential pregnancy, but PCOS may disqualify you from becoming a surrogate depending on the severity. Endometriosis can make it harder to become pregnant and increase health risks to the baby if you do become pregnant. Since the severity of endometriosis varies, it’s important to seek the guidance of a doctor on how this might impact your surrogacy journey. This is not an all-inclusive list, and there are unique medical considerations for many surrogate applicants. If you have questions, ConceiveAbilities and your doctor can educate you about how your medical conditions may impact your qualifications to become a surrogate. I’ve had healthy pregnancies. Why all of these considerations? Becoming pregnant through IVF is different than getting pregnant without intervention. The process is medically intricate, delicate, and precisely synchronized. Adherence to FDA and industry guidelines is required to maximize success of embryo implantation into your uterus. Hormone level and uterine environment have to be “just right” for an embryo to be successfully implanted. Can you become a surrogate if your tubes are tied? Yes. Since ConceiveAbilities is a gestational surrogacy agency, the egg used will always be from the intended mother or an egg donor. Getting your tubes tied, or a tubal ligation, works by stopping your own ovulation. It doesn’t impact the ability to transplant an embryo into your uterus successfully. Read more here. Can you be a surrogate after a c-section? Yes. We can accept applicants with previous caesarean sections. It is important to discuss any past C-sections with your doctor to determine the potential impacts they may have on surrogacy. Can you be a surrogate after menopause? No. We have an age requirement that all surrogates must generally be younger than 40 years of age and typically menopause occurs after this age. By nature, menopause is your body letting you know the reproductive period of your life has ended. Even if you are post-menopausal and meet this age requirement, becoming pregnant after menopause is highly unlikely and presents many risks to a successful surrogacy journey. Can you be a surrogate if you have HPV? Yes. We require the additional documentation of your colposcopy results if you are HPV positive. In the majority of cases, HPV does not impact the healthy development of a baby. It can be transmitted to the baby if you are experiencing an outbreak of genital warts, which is one of the most common side effects of HPV, during birth. If this is the case, you should be prepared to give birth via C-section. Can you be a surrogate if you have high blood pressure? Generally, no. High blood pressure increases the risk of preeclampsia and other pregnancy risks. It can decrease blood flow to the placenta, which may lead to low birth weight or premature birth. It can also lead to the slower growth of the baby or injury to your own major organs. Hypertension is linked to many health risks, if uncontrolled, for both you and a developing baby. Can you be a surrogate mother if you or your children are not vaccinated? ConceiveAbilities welcomes applicants who represent a wide range of backgrounds, values, and beliefs. We understand that there are many viewpoints surrounding vaccination and do not disqualify surrogate applicants based on whether they or their families are vaccinated. We get to know our applicants to facilitate a perfect match and supportive relationship from the start, so during your screening you should plan to discuss your beliefs and reasoning about vaccinations. ConceiveAbilities will work with you to navigate how this may impact your path to becoming a surrogate. Reputable surrogacy agencies like ConceiveAbilities have years of experience crafting their medical requirements for surrogates with the goal of increasing chances of a successful surrogacy journey. The health of you, the surrogate, and the baby throughout surrogacy is our top priority, so we uphold strict medical standards, developed with the considerations of fertility clinics.

We ask that our surrogates must: Have a BMI below 35, and ideally below 30 Be a non-smoker living in a non-smoking home Have no history of severe anxiety, depression or other mental illnesses 3) You are the right age We look for surrogates between the age range of 21 and 39 years old, although surrogacy may be a viable option for women into their early 40s. Surrogates must be at least 21 years old to help ensure the necessary level of emotional maturity and responsibility to enter into the significant undertaking that is surrogacy. 4) You have already given birth to your own child(ren) This standard is included in guidance from the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) for gestational carriers and, practically speaking, is a requirement of all leading fertility clinics. Your prenatal and delivery records, indicating a history of uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries, will be required. Do not worry, our surrogate engagement team helps to track all required records down for you. 5) You are a good communicator Part of being an awesome surrogate is just keeping everyone in the loop. During certain phases of your journey you will be asked to consistently check in with the agency and your intended parents. Timely and consistent communication will mean the world to your Intended Parents and thanks to our matching methodology, you should find it easy to communicate with one another. 6) You are financially stable Reputable agencies, such as ConceiveAbilities, only work with women who are in a stable financial position. We work with you to ensure that your lifestyle is conducive to a healthy and low stress pregnancy. We consider multiple factors to determine financial stability and typically no one factor, such as whether you receive government assistance, is disqualifying. Our surrogate engagement team will work through specific questions with you regarding this or any other qualification as part of reviewing your registration form and getting to know you. 7) You are tenacious Some journeys are as easy as pie: the surrogate becomes pregnant on the first transfer attempt, everyone is thrilled and there are no bumps along the way. While some journeys are like that, not all are. Sometimes there are bumps, disappointments, slowdowns, small challenges, or miscommunications along the way. A good surrogate is someone who can take it all in stride and focus on the bigger picture of the awesome thing she is doing for another family. She will, of course, have her fellow surrogates, her monthly mental health support group leader, dedicated Match Manager, and many other resources to help her through along the way. 8) You have a clean background Simply put, you must not have any history of criminal activity or any significant pending legal disputes or credit problems. You get it. You are going to be carrying someone’s baby. They want to know that you make good choices. If you have a small or very distant infraction on your record and are unsure of whether it is disqualifying, we will discuss that with you as we review your registration form. 9) You are supported by your friends and family A surrogacy journey is work. There can be challenges. You will need a strong support system to help you along the way. If your friends and families are the type to support you at every turn, or if they already understand and respect your surrogacy decision, you’ll be all the better surrogate for having their support. It is important to note that you do not have to be married or in a relationship to become a surrogate. Your support system could come from your family, friends, or your “tribe”. 10) You want to join the sisterhood When you become a surrogate, you not only become a part of a movement, you also join a community of other women who become your surrosisters. These women are there for you throughout your journey. You share in one another’s highs and lows. You support one another, meet up for support groups and it is often the case that you remain close friends long after you have delivered as a surrogate. In the end, your decision to become a surrogate is one that we will strive to make together, considering and balancing many factors but focused, in the end, only on whether surrogacy can be a healthy and successful experience for you. Surrogacy can be an exhilarating journey. Few things can compare to the feeling of being responsible for another family’s happiness.

At the time, a rep for the actress confirmed that “Lucy Liu is the proud mother of Rockwell Lloyd Liu, brought into the world via gestational carrier.” PHOTO: SPLASHNEWS.COM Kristen Wiig and Avi Rothman The Bridesmaids star and her fiancé are proud new parents! The couple first announced that they were engaged in August 2019, and welcomed their children in early 2020 via surrogate. While hosting a Mother’s Day special for Saturday Night Live in May, the actress coyly thanked her own mother for preparing her “to be a mom,” which left viewers scratching their heads until the happy news was confirmed one month later. PHOTO: ANDERSON COOPER/INSTAGRAM Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper became a father to his son Wyatt via surrogate on April 27, 2020. Wyatt, who is named after the journalist’s father, “is sweet, and soft, and healthy and I am beyond happy,” the proud new dad announced on CNN. “As a gay kid, I never thought it would be possible to have a child, and I’m grateful for all those who have paved the way, and for the doctors and nurses and everyone involved in my son’s birth,” Cooper shared along with a touching series of photos of Wyatt. He went on to praise the woman who carried his son for the past 9 months, saying that, “Most of all, I am grateful to a remarkable surrogate who carried Wyatt, and watched over him lovingly, and tenderly, and gave birth to him.” “It is an extraordinary blessing – what she, and all surrogates give to families who can’t have children,” he said. “My surrogate has a beautiful family of her own, a wonderfully supportive husband, and kids, and I am incredibly thankful for all the support they have given Wyatt and me. My family is blessed to have this family in our lives.” PHOTO: BENJAMIN MADDEN/INSTAGRAM Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden After over five years of trying to conceive using IVF, acupuncture, and supplements, in January 2020 Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden confirmed that they had welcomed their daughter, Raddix, via surrogate. According to a close source, “Cameron feels like this baby is truly a miracle,” and she “wants to spend every second with the baby.” PHOTO: KANDI BURRUSS/INSTAGRAM Kandi Burruss and Todd Tucker The Real Housewives of Atlanta star and her husband, Todd Tucker, welcomed a baby girl, Blaze, via gestational carrier in November 2019. When asked about the decision to use a surrogate, Burruss said, “Now that it’s all said and done, I wouldn’t change a thing. It was the best decision that we could have made.” When it came to giving advice to anyone else considering IVF and/or surrogacy, Burruss said, “I would definitely say go forward. The research is the main thing. And then you just gotta trust and believe and just go for it.” PHOTO: RICKY MARTIN/INSTAGRAM Ricky Martin and Jwan Yosef The couple welcomed their fourth child, Renn Martin-Yosef, via surrogate in October 2019. On October 29, Martin shared on Instagram, “Nuestro hijo Renn Martin-Yosef ha nacido,” which translates to “our son Renn Martin-Yosef was born.” The little boy joined older sister Lucia and twin sons Valentino and Matteo to complete the happy family of six! PHOTO: ANDY COHEN/INSTAGRAM Andy Cohen On the Dec. 20, 2018 episode of Bravo’s Watch What Happens Next Live, the executive producer and host, 50, revealed he’s expecting his first child via surrogate. He told viewers that “family means everything to me and having one of my own is something that I have wanted in my heart for my entire life.” On Feb. 4, 2019, he shared the happy news of son Benjamin Allen’s arrival. “I’m in love,” he wrote on Instagram alongside a blissful shot of the two of them together. PHOTO: GABRIELLE UNION-WADE/INSTAGRAM Gabrielle Union-Wade and Dwayne Wade In November 2018, the actress and her NBA star husband surprised fans when they revealed that they had secretly welcomed a baby girl via surrogate, daughter Kaavia James. The couple announced their daughter’s birth on Instagram, as Union, who previously opened up about her fertility struggles, announced that “we are sleepless and delirious but so excited to share that our miracle baby arrived last night via surrogate.” She went on to say, “11/7 will forever be etched in our hearts as the most loveliest of all the lovely days. Welcome to the party sweet girl! #onelastdance #skintoskin @dwyanewade.” PHOTO: KIM KARDASHIAN WEST/INSTAGRAM Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West Kanye and wife hired a surrogate to carry their third child, Chicago, and did it again for baby No. 4, PEOPLE confirmed in January 2019. “We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care,” the reality star wrote on her website after the January 2018 birth of Chicago. Giving birth again isn’t an option for Kardashian West, who suffered from placenta accreta during both of her pregnancies with son Saint and daughter North. PHOTO: JIMMY FALLON/INSTAGRAM Jimmy Fallon and Nancy Juvonen The late-night talk show host and his wife have had two daughters via surrogacy. Their first daughter, Winnie, was born in 2013, and they welcomed a second baby girl, Frances, in 2014. Over the years, Fallon and his wife have been very open about their fertility issues. “It’s hard if you can’t have children. We struggled for a good five years trying to have a kid.” After the birth of their first daughter, Fallon went on to explain, “We tried a bunch of things. Anyone who’s tried will know, it’s just awful,” he said. “So, we had a surrogate.” Fallon’s road to fatherhood wasn’t an easy one, and he insists, “If there’s anyone out there who is trying and they’re just losing hope, just hang in there.” He suggests to, “Try every avenue; try anything you can do, because you’ll get there. You’ll end up with a family, and it’s so worth it. It is the most ‘worth it’ thing.” PHOTO: NEIL PATRICK HARRIS/INSTAGRAM Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka’s children arrived with help from both an egg donor and a surrogate back in 2011. “We found an egg donor anonymously through a hilarious process of looking at people’s profiles and then an amazing surrogate who had helped a same-sex couple before,” Harris described, “And then we inserted two eggs, one with my sperm, one with David’s sperm and they both took!” Burtka has previously noted that the couple “don’t know whose is whose.”Surrogacy has made considerable progress in the past twenty years from a medical and legal perspective. For some states like Illinois, gestational surrogacy was only legally protected in the past decade. Today, many stereotypes and stigmas associated with surrogacy are becoming outdated. PHOTO: Nicole Kidman Nicole Kidman Actress Nicole Kidman already had three children prior to her surrogacy journey. In December 2010, she revealed that her fourth child, Faith Margaret, was gestated by a surrogate in the United States (due to restrictive surrogacy laws in her native Australia). “Our family is truly blessed, and just so thankful, to have been given the gift of baby Faith Margaret,” she and her husband said in a statement. “No words can adequately convey the incredible gratitude that we feel for everyone who was so supportive throughout this process, in particular our gestational carrier.” PHOTO: Giuliana Rancic Giuliana Rancic E! News Host Giuliana Rancic discovered she had breast cancer after a few IVF cycles and a miscarriage. Her cancer treatment meant that she had to use surrogacy as a means to starting her family. Finally, she and her husband welcomed a son, Edward Duke, who was born in 2012 via a surrogate named Delphine. Unfortunately, their attempts to have a second child resulted in miscarriages. “Bill and I are blessed beyond words to welcome Edward into our lives,” Giuliana said to E! News. “Thank you so much to everyone who supported us along the way.” PHOTO: Elizabeth Banks Elizabeth Banks Actress Elizabeth Banks also struggled to grow her family before turning to surrogacy. Today she and her husband have two children, Felix and Magnus, both by a surrogate. In a 2012 interview in Women’s Health, Banks discussed how she moved past having someone else carry her baby for her: “Once my focus became the baby and not the pregnancy, it was a very easy decision.” “Like Felix, Magnus was born via gestational surrogate. This experience has exceeded all expectations, taught us a great deal about generosity and gratitude, and established a relationship that will last a lifetime,” Banks told People Magazine.

    "content": "You may have decided that surrogacy is right for you. You’ve done the research, you’ve spoken to your friends, your family, and your physician. Now is the time to choose a reputable surrogacy agency. As Dr. Daniel Shapiro, of Reproductive Biology Associates, shares the minefield of sifting through all the disparate information online to make a decision. He suggests that an agency that knows the players and has high quality experience is the place to start. While thousands of families have chosen ConceiveAbilities because of our values, experience, and staff, we hope to help your research by providing a set of criteria and important questions you can use as you consider the best surrogacy agency for you. Hopefully, you will feel better equipped with the knowledge of what separates the best surrogacy agencies from all others. Reputation How many years has the agency been in business? What do other people say about the business? What does the agency say about themselves? Start your research by learning about the reputation of different agencies. What does their brand and website represent about them? What kind of accomplishments or awards have they earned? Do they adhere to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines for surrogacy? Remember to check reviews on Facebook, Google, and other social media websites. Thoroughly read the comments left by parents and surrogates explaining their rating. Expertise What is the screening process like? Who works there? Do they partner with fertility centers? Who are the experts involved in evaluating a gestational carrier’s suitability? It’s important to listen to the conversation around an agency, and it’s equally important to research the actual work the agency does. Start with their screening process and surrogate requirements. What criteria does the agency use in selecting their surrogates? A successful surrogacy journey hinges greatly on the quality of the surrogates and how an agency treats both surrogates and intended parents alike. Try checking the company’s LinkedIn page to learn more about the work history of Match Managers, the executive team, and other key personnel. Surrogacy requires skills and experience and you want to be sure you’re working directly with people who have a complete understanding of the industry and the process. Value What protections are in place for both parents and surrogates? How comprehensive is their team? How much do they insource rather than outsource? There are a lot of resources that go into an effective surrogacy journey, so the best decision may not always be the seemingly cheapest option. Rather, you should question the value of the agency’s services. The best surrogacy agencies will walk you through every expense, and explain the reason behind the cost. Transparency is important. With so many options, choosing the best surrogacy agency is a matter of choosing the best one for you and your family. If you’re a surrogate, you want to partner with an agency that protects you and values you. If you’re a parent, the right agency will match you with the right surrogate and help you come home with a new member of the family. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate?

    "content": "Over the past twenty-five years, Chicago has cemented its reputation as a fertility hub in the minds of both international and US citizens alike. Just as San Francisco is home to the tech startup industry, and Los Angeles is known for the movie business, Chicago is becoming synonymous with the fertility industry. So what factors are at hand here? What has led to the popularity of surrogacy in Chicago? Today we explore the factors responsible for shaping the Windy City into the family-building hub that it is today. 1: Chicago Fertility Clinics Did you know that Chicago is home to some of the country’s leading fertility experts? It’s true. Chicago boasts a sizable number of elite clinics. And although ConceiveAbilities is proud to work with all of our esteemed clinic partners who are scattered throughout the United States, there certainly is something fun about being able to claim so many of these distinguished institutions and professionals as close neighbors.Learn more about our clinic partners here. 2: ConceiveAbilities Established in 1996 ConceiveAbilities was started in Chicago, Illinois, in 1996. We don’t want to brag, but it’s no coincidence to us that for over twenty-five years, ConceiveAbilities has remained at the forefront of helping folks in the Chicago area, and well beyond, build their families. And although we now have offices in New York, Denver, Atlanta, Houston and many other locations, our oldest roots are in Chicago. 3: Surrogacy-Friendly Laws The state laws in Illinois provide one of the most “surrogacy-friendly” environments in the entire United States. Illinois is one of the best places for your surrogacy arrangements because Illinois surrogacy laws provide protective and considerate guardrails for the safety and well-being of all involved parties. It is no wonder that people flock to Illinois for their family building.Learn more about Illinois surrogacy law here. 4: Convenient Airports Unlike some other locations, Chicago seems to have the traveler in mind. With both O’Hare and Midway as airport options, travelers can expect plentiful flights at reasonable costs. The direct international flights to Chicago make life a little bit easier for Intended Parents who may be racing to meet their surrogate and baby in the delivery room. 5: Community of Support Chicago is lucky to have not only a large number of licensed mental health professionals who specialize in fertility but also several well-established meetup groups and nonprofits devoted to providing support for those suffering from infertility.Learn more about the Chicago area peer-led support groups offered through RESOLVE on their website. Learn more about Shine, a nonprofit organization that supports women through their fertility journey by providing free mentorship, support, and education to empower and promote a proactive approach to fertility and women’s health. Calling All Surrogates Are you a woman in Chicago, Illinois, the midwest, or anywhere else in the United States who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family? Have you ever considered the role you could play in helping someone else build their family – as a surrogate?

    "content": "As Father’s Day approaches, we’d like to shift our attention to the many intended fathers who are looking forward to adding a little bundle of joy to their families! Father’s Day is an important day to celebrate these men throughout the various stages of their surrogacy journeys, as well as those who have not yet begun their journeys. We are so happy to celebrate intended fathers across the world! This Father’s Day is especially special for one of our own ConceiveAbilities’ fathers, Harrison Katzen, who recently welcomed baby boy Jonathan with his wife, Ashley. Harrison and Ashley always knew they wanted to have a child, but shortly after they began dating, Ashley had to tell Harrison that she wouldn’t be able to have children. Diagnosed at a young age with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH), a disorder that occurs in females and mainly affects the reproductive system, Ashley struggled with the knowledge of the emotional and physical difficulties it would take for her to deliver a baby. In Ashley’s case, MRKH meant that while she still carried eggs, her body didn’t develop a uterus or cervix. Knowing the anxiety that Ashley felt in sharing this information to him, Harrison took the news in stride. As the couple discussed options to build their family, surrogacy came up in conversation and started their adventure into parenthood. We recently had the opportunity to catch up with Harrison about his family’s surrogacy journey, and we chatted with him about how he’ll be spending his very first Father’s Day! A Father’s Surrogacy Journey ConceiveAbilities: When did Ashley first tell you about her diagnosis of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) and what were your initial thoughts? Harrison: Ashley first told me about her diagnosis a few months into us dating. I vividly remember the conversation in our apartment as Ashley was understandably very nervous to tell me about it. I can only imagine falling in love with someone who you want to marry and spend your life with, and then being paralyzed by the fear of potentially losing that person due to something completely out of your control. It was a lot to take in at once to be honest. My first thought was with Ashley, and the emotional duress that she had endured thus far in her life. In addition to the physical pain from the rehabilitation, the mental anguish that she had to experience at such a young age was terrible. I then realized that I needed to educate myself on surrogacy and what our path forward would be to have a family. The thing that made it easier to understand was Ashley’s capability to clearly explain that we DID have the ability to create a family via surrogacy. ConceiveAbilities: What types of conversations did you have surrounding building a family that led to choosing surrogacy? Harrison: We are both family-oriented people and knew that we wanted to have children of our own. Ashley knew what our path forward would be, so for me, I just needed to educate myself on what surrogacy would entail, the challenges we would face, and what would be required for us to bring a child into his world. We talked about the importance of finding the right agency to work with, as well as deciding what things were going to be deal breakers for us in the process. I knew that this was our option to have a family and that it was important to embrace that fact. As opposed to being upset or doubting ourselves, I chose to look at the unique path that we would have in creating our family. ConceiveAbilities: Walk us through your decision process to work with ConceiveAbilities. Harrison: When we started the agency search process it was a little daunting – and even similar to dating! We met with representatives from various agencies and got to know their process. By the time we met a representative from ConceiveAbilities and learned about their unique process, we knew immediately they were the most professional organization we had spoken with and that we would be using them to help us find our surrogate. Once we reached this milestone, Ashley and I felt so much better because we knew we were on our way! ConceiveAbilities helped us navigate the search of finding a surrogate and what was especially helpful was that we had a dedicated counselor who helped us figure out what was most important to us in finding our surrogate. There are difficult decisions that each family must make as to what is most important. Our counselor was there for us, answering every question we had and helping us to navigate through that initial period. A few months later we heard back from our counselor that they had a potential surrogate whom they thought was the right match for us. We set up an interview and spoke with Jenna and her husband for an hour or so, getting to know them, what their priorities were, her pregnancy experiences, and why she was doing this. We had an amazing first meeting and then spoke with our counselor about what would be the next steps. Our counselor informed us that we had 24 hours to make a decision if we wanted to move forward with Jenna as our surrogate. At the time, we were overwhelmed. Jenna was the first potential surrogate we had been introduced to, and we couldn’t understand why we had to make a decision so quickly, nor why we weren’t allowed to meet another potential surrogate during that time. Looking back, it’s a testament to the process that ConceiveAbilities has implemented. The 24-hour rule, as I’ll call it, is done for both the protection of the intended parent as well as the surrogate. This is an emotional process and there was a lot of thought put into implementing this policy from a mental wellness perspective. After discussing the decision in front of us, we knew Jenna was the right fit. ConceiveAbilities: Did you know right away that Jenna was the right surrogate for you and Ashley? Harrison: We instantly knew that Jenna was an amazing human being! Meeting your surrogate is similar to dating, and so meeting your surrogate initially over Zoom can be tough. You are taking a huge leap and naturally there are feelings of wanting to make sure you make the right decision because it is so important. Jenna was the first surrogate that we met, and the only reason I think we did not know immediately if she was the right person for us is that we had no frame of reference. Jenna is family to Ashley and I now. We experienced a unique connection with her, and her family. They have been such a blessing to us. Our son is truly a miracle baby and we have Jenna to thank for that! We have so much gratitude for what she has done for Ashley and I; it’s very difficult to put into words. Saying thank you to someone who has provided us with the ability to have a family of our own is an understatement to say the least. We are forever indebted to the sacrifices she made for us and she will always be dear in all of our hearts. Welcoming Baby Jonathan ConceiveAbilities: Jonathan’s birth story didn’t quite go as planned. How did you feel when you got the phone call from Jenna’s husband? Harrison: That was a crazy experience! We had already made the decision to travel to Minnesota when Jenna was 37 weeks, before the scheduled birth date. Our son was a few days ahead of schedule in terms of growth and we just had a feeling he would be coming early. What we didn’t know was how early he would come! The night before we were set to fly out there, I got a late-night call from Jenna’s husband, Tony, who explained that Jenna was experiencing heavy contractions and had been admitted into the hospital. ConceiveAbilities: What emotions did you experience being long-distance during Jonathan’s birth and what was it like watching his birth via FaceTime? How was your journey as an intended parent impacted by this change in your birth plan? Harrison: I was really sad at first because I knew how important it was for Ashley to be there for the birth of our son. She felt as though she had been robbed of the experience of being able to carry our child on her own and she wasn’t going to miss the birth because that was all we had. That feeling is completely natural and expected – but I want to let all other future intended mothers know to embrace the unexpected. Everyone’s journey is unique and there is no magic path. Once we realized that Jenna was definitely going into labor, we had to quickly adjust our mindset and prepare for the birth of our son. We wanted to be in a positive frame of mind when Jonathan came into this world. And that’s exactly what we did. Watching Jonathan’s birth on FaceTime was such a surreal experience, and it all happened so quickly. Jenna and her husband were simply amazing. They made sure that we experienced the entire birth and our connection to the two of them grew stronger through that experience. Jenna did skin to skin for us in our absence, and her husband cut the umbilical cord which was an honor. The doctors and nurses at the hospital were also so unbelievable. They knew we were missing the birth in person and were so accommodating given the situation. Although it was not our ideal situation, there was so much beauty in that experience and seeing the best in humanity. We were on a flight a few hours later and arrived at the hospital within 12 hours of his birth. It was a wild ride to say the least. ConceiveAbilities: What was it like seeing your son for the very first time? Harrison: It was the happiest day of my life. Other than when I married my wife, of course! The nurses actually videotaped Ashley and I walking into the room so we could remember that experience forever. He was just sleeping so peacefully and it was amazing to be able to hold him in my arms knowing that we had finally completed our journey. ConceiveAbilities: What plans do you have for your first Father’s Day? Harrison: To enjoy the day with my family and to embrace that I have started this new chapter in my life. I just want to hang out with my son, and enjoy this time when he is an infant because it goes by so fast. It will be nice to slow down for the day, that’s for sure! ConceiveAbilities: How has becoming a father changed you? Harrison: I am no longer just responsible for myself. The power of fatherhood comes with true responsibility and that is so empowering. Also, the simple joy of seeing your child smiling back at you fills your heart. Purpose is an important part of living a fulfilled life and there is no greater purpose than providing the best life possible for your children. ConceiveAbilities: What would you tell other hopeful dads who are considering beginning a surrogacy journey? Harrison: It’s important to educate yourself about the entire process and what it entails. Everything from IVF to finding the right agency, to having those hard conversations with your significant other. It’s definitely not an easy journey, but it is so unbelievably rewarding. Make sure that you are dedicated to the process and that you have an open mind. And that not everything will go as planned, because I can attest to the fact that it does not. ConceiveAbilities: Is there anything else you’d like to add? Harrison: I would like to thank the team at ConceiveAbilities for matching us with Jenna who will be in our family forever and also for the professionalism they have shown in our surrogacy journey. There are so many variables and unknowns that it’s impossible to have a certain answer for everything. The process and support system that is in place for intended parents is truly best in class!

    "content": "As Dr. Eve Feinberg of Northwestern Fertility and Reproductive Medicine explains, one in eight couples who tries to conceive is afflicted with infertility, a potentially devastating diagnosis. When you’re trying to have a baby, you’ll hear countless methods and infertility choices that may help you build your family. Many women have had success with a surprising treatment option: Letrozole, a drug commonly used to treat cancer. These are five things you should know about Letrozole for infertility. 1. What is Letrozole? Letrozole, also used under the trade name Famara (Femara), is an oral medication that functions as an aromatase inhibitor. This helps prevent the conversion of androgen to estrogen, effectively suppressing estrogen production. Women who have been diagnosed with hormone-receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer often take the drug after surgery, chemotherapy or radiation to help reduce the risk of cancer returning. Because Letrozole specifically reduces estradiol levels in the body, it caught the attention of reproductive endocrinologists. 2. What does Letrozole do for fertility? In the simplest terms, Letrozole induces ovulation. As estrogen levels drop, the pituitary gland senses this decrease and secretes the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to increase estrogen in an attempt to maintain optimum hormonal balance. By generating FSH, the ovaries are stimulated to grow more follicles. Letrozole boosts this growth and release of eggs in women who are anovulatory, or not ovulating, and can cause superovulation in women who are already able to ovulate. In both cases, it increases the chances of natural conception. Another benefit of Letrozole for fertility? It improves endometrial thickness. 3. Is Letrozole better than Clomid? Among women without PCOS, studies have shown that there is no difference between Letrozole and Clomid, or that Clomid is the superior treatment. Historically, Clomid has been a popular first option to try during fertility treatment, especially for women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). Clomid falls in a class of medication called clomiphene citrate, which lasts in the body for an extended period of time and may actually have a negative effect on cervical mucus and uterine lining. Research is beginning to show that women with PCOS do not respond well to it. For women with PCOS, a 2013 study shared at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine had convincing results. Among 750 women, the cumulative live birth rate was higher with Letrozole (27.5%) as compared with Clomid (19.5%). A study in 2014 showed Letrozole to perform better, with higher live-birth and ovulation rates among infertile women with PCOS. 4. What are side effects of Letrozole? The majority of the data on the side effects of Letrozole come from women who use it as part of a five-year cancer treatment regimen. Most women who use Letrozole for fertility, however, use it for just five days and find, if there are any side effects, they are similar to Clomid treatments. Side effects of Letrozole can include: Hot flashes Headaches Breast tenderness Fatigue Leg cramps Some women also find that infertility drugs that improve ovulation may also result in anxiety, mood swings, and irritability.Importantly, Letrozole cannot be taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Research shows it may cause damage to developing embryos. A 2014 study dedicated to this research found that congenital and chromosomal abnormalities were found in 5 out of 201 (2.5%) of babies conceived with the help of Letrozole, compared to 5 of 171 (2.9%) of babies conceived naturally and 10 of 251 babies (3.9%) conceived with Clomiphene. The conclusion showed no significant difference in the overall rate of congenital malformations for children born to mothers who conceived naturally versus using Letrozole or Clomiphene treatments. 5. What are the treatment protocols for taking Letrozole as a fertility treatment? Candidates for Letrozole are carefully assessed and evaluated and follow specific guidelines for how and when to take Letrozole. You can read more here. When do options such as surrogacy and egg donation come into the fertility picture? Since Letrozole only addresses ovulation, it doesn’t impact other potential root causes of infertility. The odds of achieving a pregnancy are best when both the egg and sperm come from young, healthy sources that have met specific medical criteria. This may mean using an egg donor. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, IVF with a donor egg has a success rate of 52%, which is the highest of any fertility treatment. Higher still is the rate of success with a surrogate. IVF clinics in the US have a surrogacy success rate of about 75%, and that number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. It’s important to understand your options when it comes to infertility treatment. If you’ve considered surrogacy or an egg donor to build your family, contact ConceiveAbilities. Our team is excited to share more information, success stories and support as you make your decision. And, are you a woman who enjoyed a healthy and successful pregnancy? Do you have friends or family who have suffered from infertility or need assistance from someone else to build their family?

    "content": "Today and every day, we celebrate mothers across the world in any stage of their surrogacy journey. However, Mother’s Day can often be an emotional day for women who have not yet been able to achieve their motherhood goals. Thankfully, with the gift of surrogacy, their time is nearing. This Mother’s Day, we share the heartwarming story of intended mother Morgan, her surrogate Chelsea, and their incredible journey together towards motherhood. Meet Morgan and Chelsea New York residents, Morgan and her husband Andy had been trying to conceive for over five years with multiple miscarriages. With setback after setback, including endometriosis, fibroids, several rounds of IVF and failed transfers, they decided to give the surrogacy process a try. Morgan remembers struggling with this decision, even though surrogacy would be giving them what they always wanted… a baby! “You have an idea in your head of what becoming a mom looks like and becoming a parent and a family looks like and when things don’t go according to your plan you feel a sense of disappointment.” So they moved forward with a surrogacy agency. But as they navigated through the process, Morgan found herself questioning whether the agency they initially selected was the right fit for their family. That’s when Morgan and Andy changed gears, chose ConceiveAbilities as their agency, and found that events really started to take off! Enter Chelsea. Chelsea always knew she wanted to help enrich the lives of another couple by becoming a surrogate mother. Previously a Labor and Delivery nurse, she had seen firsthand the struggles couples went through on a daily basis to conceive and have a child. With strong Midwestern values and a desire to help another family, Chelsea decided to move forward with her decision to become a gestational carrier. One night, Chelsea asked her husband if he wanted any more kids; when he answered “no,” she went ahead and put her plan into action! Within three months of working with ConceiveAbilities, Morgan and Chelsea matched! The two couples went through ConceiveAbilities’ Matching Matters process to see if they would click and, clearly, it was a match made in heaven! As they embarked on this surrogacy journey together, the two women became like sisters – talking and texting all the time. Every story has its ups and downs, however, and we recently had the opportunity to chat with Morgan and Chelsea. They reflected on their surrogacy journey together and discussed the process that led to THIS day, the one that has been long awaited for Morgan: her very FIRST Mother’s Day! The Journey Begins ConceiveAbilities: After such a perfect match, your first embryo transfer didn’t go as planned. What was that experience like, and how did you turn it into a positive one? Morgan: My embryo situation wasn’t great because I had used all the good embryos for myself and we only had one viable embryo to use with Chelsea at that point. So, Chelsea and her husband and her mother-in-law came to visit New York and do our transfer, which we were so excited for, but then we found out our embryo didn’t make it through the thaw. I really thought for the first time in my entire journey that this is not meant to be. I’m not meant to be a mom. Chelsea was really the driving force that helped me to understand that everything happens for a reason. Chelsea: I just kept explaining to Morgan that I’m big on timing. The timing was just not right. What if this whole experience was just to get us a little more comfortable with each other before we actually did the procedure to transfer the embryo. ConceiveAbilities: How did COVID affect your surrogacy journey? Morgan: In February 2020, we were able to do a round of IVF just before COVID. Once things opened back up in June, Chelsea came back to New York for our embryo transfer on June 22. Chelsea: Because of COVID, Morgan couldn’t go in with me for the transfer, however, I took pictures the whole time and documented the whole thing for her! Morgan, along with our moms, waited in the car. When we got back to the hotel, my mom asked me how I felt. I told her I was okay, but that I knew I was pregnant… I could just feel it! ConceiveAbilities: What happened after the transfer? Chelsea: Morgan’s birthday is June 29th, so I took a pregnancy test at home because I just knew I was pregnant. My husband thought I should wait to tell her, since we didn’t want to give her false hopes, but it was her birthday and this was all she wanted! So, I sent her a picture of the test and she was screaming!!! It was AWESOME and everything she and I both wanted. ConceiveAbilities: Since you live in different states, how did you stay in touch throughout the pregnancy? Morgan: We went to Missouri for the 20-week scan and got to visit Chelsea’s hometown. They had a welcoming party for us and the whole family was there! That was really, really special, amazing and very unique. We texted every day before that, but our relationship really grew after the 20-week scan, especially since we got to meet her children and get to know her family. There was just a special bond that formed between us from that point on. Chelsea: My family was SO EXCITED for Morgan and Andy! It was just so easy because Morgan and I are close and we communicate well. I took pictures and FaceTimed them for some of the scans. After each ultrasound, I got pictures that I was able to send to her. I didn’t want to leave anything out because my biggest goal after we became pregnant was to make sure that Morgan knew that she was mom and that she knew everything that was going on throughout the pregnancy. Surro-baby Maximus arrives ConceiveAbilities: Could you tell us about your birth story? Chelsea: From about 20 weeks, I told Morgan this baby won’t make it past 37 weeks. I just know myself and my body. Lo and behold, I got induced at 37 weeks because of hypertension. Morgan: We flew out there a few days before the induction to make sure we were able to see Chelsea before she went to the hospital. It was emotional because I knew Chelsea didn’t want us to miss the birth and it was important to her for us to be there. We had the most beautiful experience in the hospital, as it was a very intense and emotionally charged event. ConceiveAbilities: Was it everything you imagined? Chelsea: It was so much more than I imagined. Obviously, I was prepared to have a baby. But my main concern was making sure that Morgan felt like mom. This whole journey was about making sure that she knew that she was mom and felt like mom. I asked the nurse to direct all questions to Morgan and to make sure they included her in every decision. It’s a big experience, and making those calls in the moment is part of it. You’re getting ready to have your baby, so I wanted to make sure she was involved. Morgan: I remember when I started the journey thinking, “Am I going to be bonded to my baby, because I didn’t carry him?” After going through this journey, I believe that’s the biggest misconception about surrogacy. I remembered thinking, “How will my baby know? How will he know I am his mother?” Believe me, they know. And, honestly, there was just something comforting about seeing the woman that just guarded my child with her life for 9 months help to bring him into the world. It was the complete opposite of how I originally expected I would feel. After Maximus was born, we never left Chelsea’s room. The hospital had set up another room for our family of three to move into after the birth, but we wanted to be there with her. You don’t know how you’re going to feel or how the surrogate is going to feel after the baby is born, but Chelsea was so proud and so happy. It was just a love bubble! ConceiveAbilities: What advice would you give intended parents that are starting their own journey? Morgan: I would tell them to not be afraid to take the leap and to explore options of surrogacy. At the end of the day, all of the resources that we exhaust trying to get pregnant are very expensive and taxing on the body. Be open-minded about building your family through surrogacy, because you might be really pleasantly surprised and save yourself the time, money and effort. My second piece of advice is if something doesn’t feel great, it’s probably not a great fit. You know yourself, so listen to your intuition. If you feel like you’re just another number, or being put through like a factory with your profile, it’s probably not right for you. ConceiveAbilities: Morgan, this is going to be your first Mother’s Day – are you planning anything special? Morgan: We are planning just to be together; the three of us. I feel so grateful to finally be a mother, but I’m also feeling for other people that still can’t. I know I won’t forget that feeling, even though I’m on the other side of it. I know that a lot of people are struggling still, and I know what that feels like to want something and feel hopeless. My message to others is to not to give up. Take the pauses and the mental health breaks that you need along the way, but do not give up. You know in your heart and you know what God’s plan will be, and what’s meant to be, will be. If you believe in your heart that you’re meant to be a parent, you will be. ConceiveAbilities: Are there any words of encouragement you’d like to share with anyone considering surrogacy? Chelsea: If you’ve considered becoming a surrogate, do it! Do not hesitate to give someone such an amazing gift! I am so grateful and blessed because of Chelsea. This is by far one of the best things that has happened in my life! ConceiveAbilities: Chelsea, is there any message you would like to send Morgan on her First Mother’s Day? Chelsea: I want to say Happy Mother’s Day! Morgan, if anyone deserves to be a mother, it is you. I know what a great mom Maximus has and I’m so happy for you! You have grown into a strong, fearless mother and you had it in you the whole time. Tough is an understatement for the last year, but I feel like there’s nothing you cannot handle!

    "content": "Ashley Katzen and her husband recently welcomed their first born son to the world. The couple had diligently planned every step of the process and were looking forward to the big day that was quickly approaching. As the saying goes, however, “The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” Jonathan Lawrence Katzen decided he was ready to meet mom and dad two weeks ahead of schedule, surprising everyone with his early arrival! We asked Ashley to share her reflections surrounding her son’s unexpected entrance with us, and here’s what Ashley had to say: “The statement ‘nothing ever goes as planned’ couldn’t be any more true than with our birth story. We were originally scheduled to have a C-section at 39 weeks and were planning to arrive a week in advance to spend some extra time with our surrogate, Jenna, ahead of the delivery date. As the weeks progressed, I kept finding myself talking to my husband about what I envisioned would happen while witnessing the birth of our first born son. We described to one another how unbelievably amazing the experience would be for us. Being present for our son’s birth was absolutely the anticipated peak of our surrogacy journey. At 36 weeks, we made an executive decision to travel to Minnesota at 37 weeks – two full weeks ahead of schedule – based on the evolution of our pregnancy and how it was developing. Exactly one day before our planned flight, my husband received a call from our surrogate’s husband that her water broke. When he gave me this news, my emotions were all over the place… A mix between fear, sadness, disappointment, anger, excitement and happiness washed over me in waves. I could not believe that I’d waited my entire life for this moment and, now, I was going to miss it. My tears and overwhelming panic couldn’t be contained. Everything escalated so quickly from that point on, and before we knew it, we received a FaceTime from our surrogate’s husband indicating that she was going in for a C-section immediately. Thankfully, we were on video chat for the entire birth experience which was truly surreal! We have been so blessed to have matched with such a wonderful woman who nurtured our child until we arrived at the hospital. My husband and I have promised each other that we will teach our son all the different ways a child can come into this world – and that even though he is genetically ours, without Jenna, he wouldn’t be here. It has officially been 6 weeks since we have welcomed our son, Jonathan Lawrence Katzen, earth side and we could not be happier!” Enjoy some pictures that highlight the joy of Ashley’s recent birth experience: And, one more picture of beautiful baby Jonathan tucked in for a snuggle with his mom and dad.

    "content": "At ConceiveAbilities, we work tirelessly to help hopeful people build families which includes identifying those women with the inclination and qualifications to help others by serving as surrogates and egg donors. We strive to be a force for good in the broader field of fertility and partner with others who share these aims. To that end, just in time for Mothers Day 2021, we are so very proud to share our partnership with the Chicago Coalition for Family Building. President and founder, Dr. Eve Feinberg of Northwestern Fertility and Reproductive Medicine and Vice President Dr. Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron of Fertility Centers of Illinois recently sat down with us to share their mission to help make dreams of family-building come true. The Coalition has brought together over 10 Chicago fertility clinics, leading Reproductive Endocrinologists, and many surrogate professionals and agencies including ConceiveAbilities to help support one mission: to provide financial assistance to individuals or couples who are struggling to afford fertility treatment or adoption. To date, the Coalition has given 92 grants with 46 live births to date. In 2021, the Coalition anticipates giving out 21 grants, which will be its biggest year so far, which includes the Deborah Frank Memorial Grant. Deborah Frank, unfortunately, lost her life to uterine cancer. Her family set up a fund to help others who want to become parents in her honor and provides up to $50,000 for an individual or family embarking on a surrogacy journey. This grant helps couples with costs including medical fees to create a healthy embryo through in-vitro fertilization, agency fees to find the surrogate, a stipend for the surrogate herself, and fees for psychological assessments, legal work, insurance, and escrow fees. If you are using a gestational carrier to build your family and live in Illinois or the surrounding states, hear from Dr. Feinberg more about the Deborah Frank Memorial Grant. If you are a member of the Chicagoland Jewish community, you may be eligible for the grants funded by the Jewish United Fund. In addition to the surrogacy grant, Dr. Feinberg also told us about family building grants that are also available to help defray costs of infertility treatments. The Chicago Coalition for Family Building is accepting applications for all grants now through June 1, 2021. Learn more about the grants available and how to apply here. And, perhaps as the most important gift in helping others who need assistance to build their family do so, if you are a woman that is interested in being a surrogate, please consider applying today. We are thankful for the women who choose to be gestational carriers every day. In tribute to the women who give the gift of family on this Mother’s Day 2021, ConceiveAbilities has made a generous donation to the Deborah Frank Memorial Grant.",

    "content": "One of the most important relationships a woman has in her life is her relationship with her Ob-Gyn doctor. We have hopeful and silly conversations as well as tough and scary conversations with our doctors. When a woman is deciding to become a surrogate, she looks to her trusted obstetrician for their guidance and expert advice. Dr. Heather Carlson with the Mankato clinic has cared for surrogates and delivered many surro-babies in her 15 years servicing her community. Nazca Fontes, founder of ConceiveAbilities and host of the All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast, talked with Dr. Carlson about her experiences working with surrogates and, along the way, did a bit of myth-busting. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take on Dr. Carlson’s perspective. NF: How important is research for your patients who are considering surrogacy?“So many of my patients are already so well-informed because of the research they have already done. They just want to know that I’m going to be there, that I’m going to support them, and that they are my patient. Our relationship is key to the process that even with all of these folks involved in a surrogacy journey and these hopeful and joyful intended parents, the bond between the surrogate and her doctor is really paramount. And it does set the tone for a positive journey.” NF: What are two considerations that you think are at the forefront of surrogates’ minds?“Everyone obviously considers how they would feel giving this baby up. They are very well aware it’s not their baby, but it is important for them to think about how they would feel delivering the baby to the parents after feeling the baby grow inside of them. Most people have already gone through that thought process before they’ve talked to me, but we do talk about that a little bit more because I’ve learned it is important for them to be emotionally prepared that they are just carrying the baby. Secondly, it’s their body, but their body’s on rent in a way. A lot of the medical decision-making isn’t going to be solely based on their wishes necessarily. It’s definitely a conversation between them and the biological parent. Understanding how they are going to deal with that aspect is imperative. Some patients are not going to deal with that as well, because they’re very independent. Other people are better at compartmentalizing that decision and understanding that it is a surrogacy decision versus one that they would make if they were pregnant with their own child.” NF: Let’s bust some surrogacy myths. Right? Some folks second guess surrogates’ intentions. In your experience, why do you think women want to become surrogates?“Surrogates want to help others become a mom or a family. What I probably hear the most often is, ‘My pregnancy was never difficult or hard for me, and I can’t imagine not being able to have children. I feel like I would be a good person to give that to someone else.’ I think that is true for my patients and very admirable.” NF: Another myth is about tubal ligation. Some gestational carriers have heard they can’t be a surrogate if they have had their tubes tied. Is this true?“No, it doesn’t matter because they’re not using their eggs. As long as they have a uterus that’s working and capable of carrying a child, they can be a surrogate.” NF: A big myth that swirls around for folks who don’t know how surrogacy works is the misconception about genetics. Will the baby have any shared DNA with a surrogate mother or look like the surrogate? Let’s bust this one out.“The baby’s genetics have nothing to do with the surrogate. The only way the baby may look like the surrogate is if the mom or dad of the child look similar, but it’s not genetic. It has nothing to do with the surrogate who is merely incubating that baby for that time. So no, no shared DNA.” NF: If you had one piece of advice for anyone considering surrogacy, what would it be?“Ask yourself, “Why do I want to do this?” The biggest thing that’s probably difficult for people to think about is that it’s not going to be the same as your own pregnancies. So it’s worth thinking about how this pregnancy may affect your life. What if I need surgery for this? What if I develop preeclampsia and need to go on bed rest? What if I need to have a C-section. I would also ask yourself, ‘Are you a good communicator?’ I think good, clear communication between you and your physician, you and the biological parents is the number one most important thing to make it a successful process for everyone.“ NF: What has been one of your most memorable moments delivering a surro-baby?“I just had the greatest delivery over the summer. The European couple who had gone through lots of struggle made it here in time for the delivery, which was emotional. These moments are that much more satisfying when you know all the backstory and you’ve been through it with them. Everyone involved in the delivery was that much more invested because it was so hard with COVID for them to get over here. It was a married couple, two men, so clearly couldn’t conceive on their own, but they so wanted to have this baby. They were so excited and they cared so much for their surrogate. Every single person in the room was crying well before the baby was born. The dads were sobbing openly and hugging the surrogate mom and thanking her. It was just beautiful.” NF: If you think about surrogacy and you reflect on your practice, what is your big aha moment when it comes to surrogacy?“I think, especially during these times, all of us are more convinced than ever about the importance of family and close relationships. And there’s really no better gift than to be able to help someone or give someone the opportunity to have a child and build their family.” Have more questions? Learn how to become a surrogate.

    "content": "In the surrogacy world, women who become surrogates share a special and unique bond as #SurroSisters. Maggie and Jessica are not only Surrosisters, they are sisters in real life. After Jessica completed two successful surrogacy journeys for New York families, her sister Maggie was inspired to follow in her footsteps and become a surrogate. Jessica, a Pennsylvania resident, recently gave birth to her second surrobaby on the east coast and Maggie is currently matched with her intended parents from Illinois and embarking on her first surrogacy journey while living in Colorado. Nazca Fontes, founder of ConceiveAbilities and host of the All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast interviewed Jessica and Maggie to learn why they became surrogates, how they talked with their husbands and why matching with the right intended family is so important. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take from our real life surrogate sisters. NF: Jessica, what made you want to become a surrogate?“I thought about becoming a surrogate well before my first child was born. I got the idea to look into surrogacy probably based on TV shows like Friends when Phoebe was a surrogate. It was almost like it was produced in my head over the course of my adolescence. I set it on the back burner, but once I had my first child and realized how much I loved being pregnant, that’s when I pretty much said I was all in. I started doing more research on surrogacy to learn about the process of becoming a surrogate.” NF: Maggie, how did you feel about Jessica becoming a surrogate?“I was really curious about the impact on her emotionally and physically. I didn’t really have a whole lot of information to go off of, so I started asking her questions that you might not feel as comfortable asking a surrogate going through the process. But because Jessica is my sister, I didn’t really have any of those hesitations and I could just go ahead and ask them all.” NF: Jessica, how did you husband react when you told him you wanted to be a surrogate?“He didn’t really know what surrogacy meant and immediately questioned why. After some explanation of what surrogacy actually means today, he was much more open to the idea. Having an open and honest conversation about it definitely helped him understand the difference between what I call “old school surrogacy” and a modern surrogate mother. A gestational carrier is just a woman who carries a baby that’s not genetically related to them. They’re hosting someone else’s egg and sperm or donor egg and sperm. I am not genetically involved. A surrogate mother is just the oven, as most like to say in the surrogacy world.” NF: Maggie, what motivated you to become a surrogate?“I saw how amazing Jessica’s surrogacy journeys had been. And I had gotten a lot of really sweet questions from my friends who were having some challenges conceiving who knew that Jessica was a surrogate and had seen me during my pregnancies and had jokingly asked me to be their surrogate. I didn’t hesitate for a second in thinking absolutely I would, 100%. So if I would carry a baby for one of my friends, I thought why would I not carry a baby for someone that I just didn’t know yet? I also feel like there are these moments in life that I never really experienced before kids, when your heart skips a beat. The moment they are born, but also the small moments that make your heart just skip a beat and you get to watch someone’s heart, literally just melt right there. What an amazing experience to be in the presence of that and have something to do with it.” NF: Your sister was in Pennsylvania while you, Maggie, live outside of Denver, thousands of miles away. When did you know the time was right to follow in your sister’s surrogacy footprints?“I had really started thinking of it as an option for me after I had our second son. My work is pretty flexible as a therapist and I had a really great work life balance. I was in a really great emotional space. My relationship was supportive and safe and we weren’t planning on any travel. You can’t really be traveling all over the world when you’re a surrogate. While that is something that we love to do, our kids were so young. It felt like a really good time to be able to take a break and do something for someone else.” NF: Maggie, did your husband react differently to you becoming a surrogate mother?“We had first-hand experience because of Jessica so we had already really talked about it through her journey. You have to go into surrogacy with an open mind for sure, yet you also have expectations. I was just curious if those expectations were met for Jessica and if it was an overall incredible experience for her. So there weren’t a lot of concerns, only a lot of positives. So when we talked about it, he was really supportive.” NF: Jessica, how did you know the time was right?“When my son was four months old, I decided this is what I wanted to do. I knew for sure that I wanted to be a surrogate. That same day I jumped on my phone or a computer and started researching some agencies and that actually led me to ConceiveAbilities. I had experienced the pregnancy, I had experienced the delivery and I had experienced the birth and those first few months of having a baby. I was kind of back on that train of wanting to be pregnant again. I definitely was more on the surrogacy path than thinking about having another baby of my own. So timing plays a huge role in where you are in your own life versus where your plan for surrogacy lies.” NF: Maggie, how important was matching with your intended parent(s) in the process?“ConceiveAbilities did an amazing job in connecting us through Matching Matters. I honestly didn’t know if I would be connected to a family very quickly because we did have a lot of our own personal requirements. You go through a pretty lengthy process of what value system your family holds and matching those with a family that you’re going to be a surrogate for. When we got matched with our family who lives in Oak Park, we had an initial meeting and we hit it off really well. You can usually tell within the first few minutes, few seconds even, if you’re clicking and connecting, and I really did feel very connected to them. I felt like their midwestern values and ours really aligned. We have an excellent relationship where we’re able to communicate and we’re able to support each other. But we also have our own supports in place as well, so that if we’re struggling, we don’t necessarily need to lean on each other all the time. We’re different people, in different parts of the world coming together for this one goal and one purpose that we’re both really passionate about and I respect their grit and tenacity to have a family. That takes a lot of resilience to go through.” NF: Jessica, you have had the opportunity now to work with two families, both from New York, and have two distinct relationships built. How was your experience with your intended families?“They were both equally great, just very different and very positive. My first journey was with a single intended mom who had already had a baby. Our relationship was very laid back and easy, not overbearing or overwhelming. We had very similar personalities and we could be open with each other, and yet neither of us felt this urge to be overly communicative. She always made sure that I was comfortable and reminded me of how grateful and thankful she was. We still text on birthdays and holidays and she shares photos and updates about the baby I delivered. We have a very positive relationship to this day. After having such a great first experience, I didn’t know how I could top it. For my second journey, I wanted a couple who was having their first child so I could have the excitement of firsts with them and I wanted a couple so that the experience would include my husband. I wanted him to have somebody to connect with through the journey versus just kind of him being almost like the third wheel. When we first met them, it felt like we had been friends before we even went through the whole surrogacy process, like we had known each other prior to being connected through ConceiveAbilities. My husband definitely connected on a much different level than the first journey, because he could bond with the intended father and share this experience with another man becoming a father. They have a special relationship.” NF: Maggie, what would you tell other women considering becoming a surrogate?“I would tell other women looking to become a surrogate to make sure they understand their motivations and know there is a possibility that some expectations might not be met. Do you have the supports in place? Do you have the coping skills to be able to manage an intense emotional experience? If you’re able to answer all of those questions confidently, you will have an amazing experience. You’re going to learn something one way or another, and you’re going to have tremendous personal growth no matter what the outcome is.” NF: Jessica, can you describe the moment of delivering your surrobaby to the intended family?“If you ask any surrogate, their most exciting moment is going to be delivery day. Part of the motivation in being a surrogate is that pure gift of handing a baby over at the end, whether it’s a nine month journey or a two year journey. At the end of the day, to be able to see the look on your intended parents’ faces as they receive their new gift of life is life changing. The experience as a whole, just being able to witness the pure joy and contentment on your intended parents’ faces when they see their baby for the first time is pretty much indescribable.” If you are inspired by Jessica and Maggie’s surrogate mother story, apply now to see if you qualify to be a surrogate.",

    "content": "Andrea Syrtash is a nationally recognized relationship expert, author and founder of Pregnantish, an infertility and modern family building community she created after a painstaking ten-year journey through infertility that ultimately resulted in meeting her little girl, Aria, born through surrogacy. Nazca Fontes, founder of ConceiveAbilities and host of the All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast talked with Andrea about how infertility shaped her, how she navigated the long road to parenthood and why she was determined to build a community for others experiencing similar journeys to parenthood. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take on Andrea Syrtash’s perspective. NF: Your path to parenthood was complex. Why are you so passionate to share your story through your online community Pregnantish?“So many of us have been touched personally by the experience of modern family building, so it was easy to spark my passion because I saw how underserved this topic is. Infertility and modern family creation affects millions of people. Yet sometimes it’s this big dark secret for absolutely no reason, because it’s nobody’s fault if we need intervention to build our families. I was struggling over many years and I was feeling really isolated. I needed more content and resources that I couldn’t find, which led me to create Pregnantish four years ago.” NF: Agreed. We just founded Surrogacy Learning Center, an online community to help connect people who are interested in modern family building as well. One of the things you have said often that resonates with me is, “It’s the best club that you don’t want to be a member of.”“I think this painful experience has been one that nobody really wants to navigate on their own. When you have a medical issue or you need modern family building because of other reasons, maybe you’re in the LGBT world or you’re single, whatever the case may be, people’s well-meaning advice is not helpful. When you find a community who understands the pain point and the process, it’s life changing.” NF: When did you know you would have fertility challenges?“When I started menstruating around 14 years old, a doctor suspected I had endometriosis. I remember the doctor saying I may have fertility issues later, but I was 14 and the last thing I was thinking about was getting pregnant. When I married my husband, I told him that it may take us a year or two to conceive. I laugh at myself now, because it took us eight years, 18 fertility treatments, eight doctors, miscarriages, major surgery to remove a fibroid tumor and a lot of stops and starts and heartache before we finally met our daughter. In year six of trying to conceive with fertility treatments, we saw our reproductive endocrinologist who suspected my embryos were healthy and it was my uterus. After genetic testing, my doctor said I have good news and bad news. The good news is, I think you’re going to meet your baby because you have healthy embryos. The not as good news is, I don’t think you can carry your embryo and I’d like you to consider gestational surrogacy. I had never heard of that and I knew very little about surrogacy.” NF: Was your family history a big motivator for using your own embryo?“A lot of times people will ask you when you were doing gestational surrogacy, “Why do you need your own genetics?” We have so little family left on my father’s side, because they were killed in the Holocaust. Literally. I wanted to continue our bloodline, if it was possible. If I couldn’t, I would have been thrilled to bring a baby into the world and that baby would have been mine, no question. But it did have deeper meaning for me, in terms of literally rebuilding our family.” NF: How did you know surrogacy was right for you?“Through research (I had Google on my side), I realized surrogacy has really helped a lot of people build a family. It was a relief, because after six or seven years of fertility treatments, I was tired. I had taken thousands of shots in my belly and my backside and I was relieved to think about not trying again. The whole process of finding a gestational carrier was its own crazy chapter. We worked with an agency, not as good as yours. I won’t name it, but let’s just say the agency matters a lot. We had two surrogates drop out on us. When my last surrogate ghosted us, we had already paid, done all the legal and medical steps and the transfer was about to happen. I was devastated and couldn’t get out of bed. Then miraculously, my first cousin Alana texted and asked if I had ever thought of a family member carrying for me. I was shaking so much that I could barely respond. The rest is history.” NF: You are a relationship expert and you had a husband and a career. How did you balance everything while you were going through this emotional journey?“I wasn’t as together as I may have seemed to the outside world. When I came out on Facebook saying I was infertile, the last line of my post was don’t judge a Facebook by its cover because people had seen me on TV. I’d host television shows and go on book tours, but behind the scenes I was crying and struggling to keep it together.” NF: How did infertility affect your marriage?“I try to take my own advice as a relationship expert. I think the key to healthy relationships is being direct with respect and keeping communication open, which we tried to do. My husband and I were not always on the same page. There were times that he felt that he was done. There were times I felt I was done. I often tell couples after they receive sad news on this journey like, for instance, a failed IVF transfer, don’t decide your next step in that moment. You’re not thinking clearly. You need to literally take a moment, grieve, connect with each other, communicate, and then you’ll figure out where you’re at. I think we tried to make too many decisions in moments of stress and distress.” NF: What words of encouragement do you have for other hopeful parents building their family?“You have already shown you’re going to be a great parent by the dedication you’ve put into trying to become a parent. I mean, you’re doing this for someone you haven’t even met yet. I can only imagine the love, attention and dedication you will have once this being is here.” Read more about Andrea’s surrogacy journey in People. Have more questions?

    "content": "There’s much to celebrate in New York! After years of fighting to end the ban of compensated surrogacy and legal reform for the surrogacy process, the new law, effective February 15, 2021, makes dreams of a family a reality for New Yorkers! Not only is this great news for intended parents in New York, it’s also monumental for women who want to be gestational carriers to help these families. They can now become surrogates with some of the strongest protections available in the United States. Nazca Fontes, founder of ConceiveAbilities and host of the All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast talked with our partner, pioneering fertility expert Dr. James Grifo, director of NYU Langone Fertility Center, who shared his perspective on what the law means for New York, why it needed to change, and why he loves practicing in NYC. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take on Dr. Grifo’s perspective. NF: How did you become interested in specializing in fertility?“I’ve been practicing in the fertility field for about 35 years. When I did my rotation in obstetrics and gynecology as a medical student at Case Western Reserve, it became clear this was a field that was right for someone like me. My main goal was to use science to make IVF safer and better. Since then, we’ve developed a lot of new tools and techniques that have dramatically changed the way we practice, which is very relevant for the gestational carrier setting, because getting your gestational carrier pregnant with an embryo that either doesn’t make her pregnant or has a higher chance of making a miscarriage is a problem. We now have tools where we can select embryos, put back a single embryo, have a much lower miscarriage risk and have a much better chance of a good outcome. And that’s good for everybody.” NF: When it comes to surrogacy in New York, what makes New Yorkers great partners in their surrogacy journey?“The best part about practicing in New York is the patients. New York patients are very educated and very savvy. They’re just amazing. They’re diverse: they are single men and women, lesbian couples, gay dads, and heterosexual couples. We help people build families and it’s great because loved and wanted children are the secret sauce to a better world.” NF: Why did the New York laws lag so far behind the rest of the country?“The original case that led to the New York law was Mary Beth Whitehead. She carried a pregnancy, which came from her egg. She was inseminated with the husband of the couple that was going to get the baby. In the midst of pregnancy, she changed her mind and it became this awful litigation. I think the litigators at the time, not knowing where the future was going, passed a very restrictive law that basically criminalized helping a patient have a family through a gestational carrier. What they didn’t anticipate in the law was that there would come a day where we could take eggs and embryos and make embryos from a couple or an individual and put genetic material in a gestational carrier that would not have any genetic relationship to her. So that’s where the term gestational carrier is a more precise term because it implies that this embryo has nothing to do with the carrier. She’s basically carrying a pregnancy for someone else, not related to her, so they can have a baby they otherwise wouldn’t be able to. The legislation that was passed back then prevented us from helping that couple or the woman who didn’t have a uterus because she had a hysterectomy but had embryos or the woman who was born without a uterus or the gay couple where there is no uterus. It basically cut them out of building families and what wasn’t the intent of the law. It’s a tragedy that it took this long, but thankfully it’s happening.” NF: Before the law passed, what did it mean for New Yorkers seeking surrogacy to build their families?“We had a patient in New York who couldn’t carry her own child. Her sister-in-law volunteered to be an altruistic carrier but we were terrified because we were subject to being criminals. Doing the transfer in New York at the time, as a doctor, you put your whole career on your line trying to help a patient. We know what our intent is. To think that someone out there wanted to put us in jail for that really is not a good feeling when you know what you’re doing is absolutely right. Mainly what we did was we would make embryos here. We would ship embryos to the place where the carrier would be in another state and where the laws were more friendly, like New Jersey, Connecticut, or California. It added an excessive expense and burden to the patient. It also meant they could not be local with their carrier. Then you have a law that makes it even more costly for no good reason – that’s really adding insult to injury. Thankfully now it will be okay.” NF: How will the new law impact the lives of New Yorkers going through surrogacy journeys?“It allows them to do it here in New York. They don’t have to travel and add extra cost, burden and complexity to an already complex process. It respects them as people who want to have children and they should get that respect and family building opportunity. It’s a big breakthrough for our New York patients and also for women in New York who want to be a gestational carrier because that is an amazing job that someone does. They feel like they have made a huge difference in the world by giving that gift to a couple or an individual who wants to raise a child who couldn’t otherwise carry that child. The ability to give that gift is very special.” NF: In your experience, what motivates a woman to be a gestational carrier?“They know what a gift and a privilege it is to have a child and they can only imagine what it’s like for somebody who can’t have that gift. They take their job of giving that family a gift incredibly seriously. If you’re someone who’s using a gestational carrier and you’re smart about how you manage your care, you have to treat them like they are doing the most important job in the world for you. When that happens, it’s always a win-win situation. The carrier feels great about what she’s done and the family who gets a baby, who would not have had a baby, understands what a gift and a privilege that is.” NF: What has been the biggest aha moment in the surrogacy field throughout your career?“I think the most critical aha moment for this field is single embryo transfer, which leads to such better outcomes.” NF: How is NYU Langone Fertility Center ready to serve New Yorkers choosing surrogacy?“We’re looking at the way other surrogacy professionals have worked with gestational carriers in America and trying to take the best of everything and build our process. We know the embryo side of it, that’s what we’ve been doing for years. Now, we will actually be managing the carriers, helping them get pregnant, and making sure they get optimal care. We have to do everything we can to assure that this gestational carrier will have a safe, good outcome. There’s a whole team involved in making this process happen. Working with the agencies is fun because we know we can help a whole new group of patients be a part of the surrogacy process.” Have more questions?

    "content": "As New York celebrates a new dawn, with legalization of compensated surrogacy on Monday, February 15th, read on to hear from a New York mother, Cynara, and from a gestational carrier, Sara, about what it’s been like to complete a surrogacy journey to-date. Two side with one mission. Joyful, still, but better days are ahead for hopeful parents and surrogates in New York. Cynara’s story When I imagined becoming a parent, one of the recurrent fantasies involved lovingly rubbing a growing belly and feeling the tiny life my husband and I created growing and somersaulting inside. I recall having these pleasant daydreams that only increased in frequency once we found out we were pregnant for the first time. I couldn’t wait to bond with my baby and feel that sense of connection that would only grow in size as the weeks and months passed. But, unfortunately, that was not my journey to parenthood. After several miscarriages over 10 years, my husband and I threw what we considered our “Hail Mary” pass – we decided to look into working with a gestational carrier (surrogate). Aside from the financial worries and the anxiety of not knowing whether it would work was the discovery that compensated surrogacy was not legal in New York. My husband and I were shocked and somewhat despondent. I felt betrayed by the state that I always considered to be the bastion of inclusion and progressive ideals. How could Georgia, my home state, have more progressive family planning laws than New York?! In learning of that obstacle, I had yet another hurdle to feeling connected to the life we wanted to bring into the world. Not only was I not going to be able to carry my own child, a loss in and of itself, but now I would not be able to feel connected to the pregnancy at all. Sara, the amazing person we matched with, lives in Ohio. That’s hours away from our home in Brooklyn, New York. That decision meant that I would miss doctor’s visits, the ability to feel Sara’s tummy as our baby grew, or even talk to our baby in utero. And the scariest and most worrisome concern that clouded the experience was whether we would even have the ability to make it to the hospital in time for our baby’s birth. Not only did multiple flights to and from Ohio for us and for Sarah and her husband mean added financial burden, it created more complexity and uncertainty to an already uncertain situation. What we also didn’t consider was what would happen once our baby was born and what else we would miss out on as a result. Bringing a child into the world is a very intimate endeavor and while everyone’s expectations and needs may differ, we fell in love with the Vecchi family. Sara, Matt and their boys became as important to us as our own families. If we lived in the same state, I know that the Vecchi family would have been present at every birthday party and special milestone. I want that possibility for other New York parents. I want them to have the ability to rub the belly of the person that is carrying their child. I want them to be able to easily take off a few hours to attend a doctor’s appointment. I want them to have greater certainty that they won’t miss the birth of the child they’ve so desperately wanted. That’s an experience you can’t get back and one you will never forget. And, I want New York families through surrogacy to have the opportunity to enjoy a lifetime of connection to the women and their families that gave them the most remarkable gift ever – the gift of parenthood. That’s why it was so important to me to fight for this legal right. I cried tears of joy when the law was passed, because I knew what a difference it would make to families like ours. Sara’s story My surrogate journey with the Charles-Pierre family has been hands-down one of my favorite things I have done in my life. Matching with someone to embark on this life-changing journey with you is a big deal, especially with people I had met only once face-to-face. After a couple of long phone calls, Cynara and her husband offered to fly out to meet us before we all began our partnership in earnest. We were so glad to have that opportunity, but it would have been wonderful to have the chance to interact in-person several times before making such an important decision. Matching with someone within your own state would likely make that opportunity much more feasible. Once you have gotten past the anxiety and excitement of finding a good match, you prepare for the transfer. I can actually speak from experience when I say that a transfer in your home state takes much less coordination. I certainly didn’t mind the flights we took or the stays we had out of state for both our medical evaluations and for the transfer itself, but it meant a greater expense for intended parents to cover and more organization on our end to take care of responsibilities at home while we were gone. An in-state transfer took about the same time as a workday, and I was back home to pick up my sons from the babysitter that same evening. After learning the transfer was successful, we began the longest part of our journey: nine months of slowly growing a baby. This is where I feel we missed the most. We kept in contact via text and occasional phone calls, and they came out to attend a couple doctor appointments and tour the hospital where we were to deliver. It would have been wonderful to be able to have Cynara there for more of the appointments, and these visits would have provided us more time to establish a deeper relationship. When it comes to the highlight of the whole experience, the birth, you want to be very comfortable with your intended parents. This kind of closeness came naturally in our experience, but I could easily see this being something that would only come from spending more time together, especially for those who may be more introverted in nature. The biggest challenge we faced with the delivery was getting the intended parents here in time! Natural labor happened a week earlier than expected, so I had to quickly call and give them a heads up that I was heading to the hospital. From that moment, they had to get their things, get to an airport, get a flight, fly, and then travel to the hospital from the airport. We were lucky that my labor slowed after they arrived, but there were so many variables that could have led to them missing the actual birth. I was so relieved to hear when they touched down in Ohio. One of the things that hangs over me now is how distance keeps us apart. I recognize that not every surrogate or couple may desire to remain in close contact, but I know that we are also not alone in wanting to be involved! If we were closer, we could be there for birthday parties, dance recitals, sports competitions, or whatever else the future may hold. The legalization of surrogacy in New York has opened the door for these kinds of bonds to be formed between countless families in the future. Women like me who have a desire to help families who would not otherwise have their own children will now have that opportunity. Parents like Cynara will now have the option to partner with someone closer to home and be able to extend this close and special relationship past the delivery of the baby if they so choose. This legalization allows, and maybe even encourages, the relationships which I feel make the surrogacy experience so special. Have more questions?

    "content": "Matching with your surrogate is one of the most exciting parts of your surrogacy journey. Choosing the perfect match for you and your family can also raise many questions, however, which is why we wanted to chat some more with mom-to-be, Ashley. Ashley and her husband are expecting their first baby with the help of their long-distance surrogate this spring. While matching with a long-distance surrogate can come with unique challenges, it also has its perks! Here’s a few of the reasons their long-distance surrogate was a match, and why Ashley wouldn’t have it any other way: What were your expectations when being matched with a surrogate and what have you learned since your match was made? When my husband and I started the surrogacy process, we were not really sure what expectations we should have as it was very new to us. All we knew for certain was that we wanted to find a surrogate who was totally open, honest and willing to be flexible and understanding. We also both felt it was very important for our surrogate to come from a nurturing home with a supportive and loving family. When we started working with ConceiveAbilities, we were told that matching with someone is like dating and when you know you know. That is exactly how it happened when we matched with our surrogate! The moment we hung up the phone, we knew what our expectations were and that she was everything we had hoped for. We learned that this whole experience is not only about our needs because it is our baby, but it is also about the gestational carrier’s needs which are just as important. What has made your relationship with your surrogate work so well? We got to know each other’s personalities fairly quickly, including how we each prefer to communicate and how often. We both work full time and have a mutual respect for each other’s schedule, however, we always make time to discuss pertinent information and check in as often as possible. I believe that the little bit of separation we have between Florida and Minnesota has, in fact, brought us closer together. Because of the distance, any time we catch up on FaceTime or over the phone, we try to truly live in the moment and appreciate the conversation that much more! Did you have reservations about matching with a surrogate from another state? After we matched with our surrogate, I did have some reservations. I thought there would be no way we would be able to make this whole thing work while being so many miles apart. I very quickly learned, however, that distance literally plays no part in the grand scheme of things. Traveling to Minnesota has actually been a fun and exciting part of our journey! My husband and I had never visited the state before and we have been fully embracing the time we get to share in a new place with our superstar surrogate and her wonderful family. Can you give any pros and cons of working with a long distance surrogate? The pros of being long-distance is that it forces you to be less controlling. I know that if our surrogate was local, I would feel the need to “check-in” often. With our situation, I don’t have the ability to do so and, honestly, it’s a blessing. I have also found that we cherish our relationship with our surrogate more, since our visits are limited. When we do see each other, we fully embrace the moment. For me, the biggest con is feeling a little bit more disconnected to the actual pregnancy. Often, I wish I could see our surrogate more just so that we could experience the growth of her blossoming belly bump and have the opportunity to talk and sing to our baby boy while in utero. Another con is having to be okay with a birth plan that could change. It is logistically challenging to plan when you live in different states, even with a scheduled c-section. You have to have a backup plan and be on standby for the big day! How have you maintained a long distance relationship with your surrogate? My husband and I have maintained an amazing relationship with our surrogate and mostly because we are on the same page. We know when we need to communicate and what about. We are both very understanding of each other’s expectations and respect the time, or lack thereof, that we have in our busy days. What advice would you have for people who are worried about a long distance match? There will always be pros and cons for being either long distance or nearby. Remember that. The priority should always be to just match with someone you feel truly connected to. As we have learned, the rest will fall into place.

    "content": "The use of gestational carriers for families wanting children is on the rise. That’s why ConceiveAbilities continues to support the family building process by taking further steps to expand our legal team. It’s hard to imagine that surrogacy only went mainstream in the mid-eighties and now the global surrogacy market is expected to reach $27.5 billion through 2025, according to estimates from Global Market Insights. According to the “Assisted Reproductive Technology Fertility Clinic Success Rates Report 2018” released in December 2020 by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion’s Division of Reproductive Health (CDC), surrogacy accounts for 4.7% of all embryo transfers (IVF), up from 4.2% just one year prior. And a survey done by the Family Equality Council estimates that 63% of LGBTQ people planning families will consider assisted reproductive technologies (ART) to become parents. To meet this increasing need for expanding families with the use of gestational carriers and egg donors, ConceiveAbilities continues to strengthen an already extensive legal program. Under the leadership of Director of Legal Services, Gina-Marie Madow, Esq., we work closely with Melissa Torto, Esq. and, as a combined force, Madow and Torto bring over two decades of assisted reproductive technologies (“ART”) law experience to provide legal oversight of the entire surrogacy process, from start to finish. Expanded legal services include: Providing intended parents with legal education and oversight throughout the surrogacy and/or egg donation process Establishing direct representation of intended parents for their contracts with gestational carriers and egg donors, to ensure matches are legally sound Assisting and overseeing intended parents’ establishment of their parental rights Working with local counsel in other states and countries for specific legal support as necessary as well as to staying current with ever-evolving laws Gina-Marie Madow has spent her entire career assisting thousands of parents with all aspects of their surrogacy and egg donation journeys.

    "content": "At 37, Joseph Tito was a jet-setting successful film and TV director and producer, living his dream. One early morning, he awoke in his Dubai hotel and realized he wanted more out of life. He wanted a family. He documents his fatherhood journey on his blog The Dad Diaries that chronicled his surrogacy journey as a gay single dad and, now, his parenting adventures raising twin girls. Nazca Fontes, CEO and founder of ConceiveAbilities, had an intimate chat with Joseph on our new show All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast about his journey to become a father through surrogacy, the hurdles he navigated as a single gay man and why he felt so strongly to share his story with other men like him dreaming of starting their own families. Listen to the full episode here. And, read on for a quick take on Joseph’s raw and authentic perspective. NF: How has the decision to become a dad and now raising two daughters changed your life?“How hasn’t it changed my life? I always said to myself that by the time I’m 35, I wanted to be a dad. I didn’t know how, what, where, when any of that, but I kept saying that to myself and then 35 came and went. I was executive producing and directing all over the world and traveling and so that window just passed. When I turned 37, I thought that I don’t want to be a 60 year old with a toddler. I looked into all my options and, as a gay single man at the time, there were really not that many options. Adoption was extremely difficult. So, I looked into surrogacy and that’s kind of how my journey began.” NF: What was the one moment in time that sparked your action to become a father?“I was lying in bed in a seven star hotel in Dubai. I was very fortunate. I was making great money and I had everything I wanted and could travel anywhere. But it just seemed empty and lonely. You work your whole life to try to be successful and try doing what you love. And then when you do it, you start feeling like there has to be more to life than your career. That’s when I realized, it was now or never. At the time I did have a partner, so I called him and said, “I want kids. We’ve been together for four years and we’re not getting any younger. And so let’s start this.” NF: And was your partner on board?“With his words? Yes, but not with his actions. As a gay man, you have disposable income, you can pick up and go whenever you please. So, to change that lifestyle to that of a traditional family was a very difficult decision for him. He went along with it initially. I documented the whole journey through video. I went through five embryo transfers; it was a long, painful journey. As I was editing all my stuff, I realized that I was doing it by myself and he wasn’t into it like I was.” NF: So during your journey, this partnership became an individual journey as a single man?“There was never really any partnership in the journey. Financially, it was all me and when it was time to go to Kenya to meet my surrogate, he declined because he was busy with work. After that and many other signs I said to him, “Listen, I don’t think this is something you really want. Maybe we should break up and maybe I’ll find someone who wants the same thing.” In my head I thought he would profess his love for me and realize he wanted to be a family. But he didn’t and our relationship ended. So, I was dealing with a third failed embryo transfer, which really gets to you, and dealing with that breakup as well.” NF: You wrote in your blog on The Dad Diaries that a lot of gay men didn’t understand your desire to become a father. Why do you feel that?“My friends still don’t get it. They have asked why I would change my lifestyle especially since having a kid is a lot of work. You have to put yourself aside and for a long time and live for someone else: your children. Since I didn’t have the traditional pressures to have a family, they have had a hard time understanding why I would want that.” NF: How important has support been as a single parent going through a surrogacy journey?“My parents were my biggest supporters and absolutely amazing. I first spoke to my mom about adoption and then surrogacy, she was beyond excited. I was kind of keeping it quiet from my dad. Then one day I called and he came on the phone and he was just so excited about the whole thing. I felt very supported. I went through five embryo transfers. After the fourth failed embryo transfer, I felt like maybe this wasn’t what I should be doing in my life. Maybe God doesn’t want me to be a dad. I had a lot of people also on social media that were against a gay man going through surrogacy. All those things started taking a toll. Without my parents, honestly I don’t know where I would be. Throughout the surrogacy journey and after the girls were born, my parents have been and are my greatest support.” NF: Did your parents have reservations about you as a gay single man going through surrogacy?“My mom was always amazing with me when I told her I was gay. My dad came around. I think for them, the biggest fear was that I would be alone and I would have nobody to share my life with and to support me. I think the decision to start a family put those fears away for them and that’s why they were so supportive. They were also excited that I chose surrogacy and that my genes were passed down, but mostly they were happy I was creating a family, because family is so important to them.” NF: The Dad Diaries earned an award as a top YouTube channel for single dads. Why is it so important for you to be a voice in your community?“I started The Dad Diaries because I’m in film and television and I was going to document my journey into fatherhood regardless. And also when my girls hate me as teenagers, I want to show them what I went through to have them. Joking aside, there wasn’t a lot out there for me when I began my surrogacy journey. There were a lot of countries where surrogacy as a gay man or gay couple is just not even allowed. I found a lot of research on women who are infertile who choose the surrogacy route. Even in Canada, the first IVF treatment is free, so there’s a lot of resources for women. I found that as a gay man and as a single man, I didn’t really have that. I couldn’t find resources and information that helped me navigate all of the questions and fears I had about the surrogacy process. Since then, I’ve learned about more surrogacy agencies that will help you from A to Z that I didn’t even know existed. And, there is professional help out there for sure that can help guide you through the surrogacy process and I want to share what I’ve learned. Building the community has been amazing. I get numerous amounts of emails daily from single men and gay men asking questions. They just want someone to listen to them and they just want someone to tell them that it’s going to be okay and that it will work out. For me to be able to be that person for someone else makes it worthwhile for me.” NF: If you could change anything about your surrogacy, what would it be?“I wouldn’t change anything because I have my girls, but that aside, I would definitely change the agency I picked. It’s all about your agency. They will make it easier or harder on you. The agency I chose felt very much like a business that was only concerned with the money. It lacked human connection and didn’t seem to be concerned with my individual experience or acknowledge that each journey is unique. Each one is a person and not just a client, especially when you’re talking about babies and someone’s dream. I just found it very cold. My advice to anyone thinking about surrogacy is to carefully choose the best surrogacy agency for you – one that has a good reputation for its support and service throughout the process.” NF: What lessons have you learned that could help other single men embarking on a surrogacy journey?“It takes a village for sure. Get all the help you can. I’m the type of person that tends to try to do everything by myself. If you’re going through surrogacy, and I know it’s easier said than done, you have to let it go, trust the process and ask and accept all the support you can get.” NF: I love your Instagram. How has becoming a father changed your life?“My life revolves around my family now. It’s more inclusive. My friends are different now. My best friends that I had before disappeared because they just don’t get it. My family has changed. I have a partner now. I spend more time with my extended family. I used to direct a TV show for 18 hours a day on set for a month at a time and not miss a beat. Now I’m just always exhausted. I never seem to get enough sleep and I wouldn’t trade it for the world. The other night, the girls slept at my mom’s and we wanted to take one night to sleep and just wake up when we wanted. And I woke up still at the same time, because after two years your body is up and I just had this feeling that I missed them so much. It was crazy how much I actually missed them and it was literally one day that I didn’t see them. People asked me if I would change being a dad? Maybe my life would be easier, but I couldn’t imagine my life without them.” ConceiveAbilities is proud to be a gay friendly surrogacy agency. We believe anyone who wants to be a parent should have the same opportunity to fulfill their family destiny, including gay dads. It’s our privilege to serve both single parents and same sex couples.

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has taken us all on a rollercoaster ride of emotions over the past year. While the experience has left many people feeling uncertain, Ashley Katzen and her husband decided to move forward with their surrogacy journey and are making their dream of becoming parents a reality, in spite of the global pandemic. We spoke to Ashley about her decision, how COVID has impacted their pregnancy, and why she believes other couples should not press pause on their own dreams of a family. Here’s what Ashley had to say: What made you decide to move forward with your surrogacy journey during a pandemic? I had spent all of three minutes thinking about whether or not I would postpone my goals and lifelong dream of becoming a mother because of the pandemic. In those three minutes, I thought: “This will be hard, it will be challenging logistically to travel, and it will put all of us at risk and potentially compromise our health.” Then, I thought about how this entire process is a challenge. Nothing is easy. My husband and I came up with alternatives for how we could be “present” during the process from a distance and we decided to take the risk of moving forward. At the time, there was a ban on elective procedures that was expected to be lifted right before our planned transfer day, and we were not willing to miss out on this small window of opportunity before something could potentially happen again. Luckily, our superstar surrogate was totally on board with us! How has COVID affected traveling during your surrogacy journey? Were you able to meet your surrogate in person to, for instance, do your transfer in person? How have you been handling pregnancy milestones? With the timing of our pregnancy, our travel schedule was minimally affected by the pandemic. We always planned to be present for the 20-week anatomy scan, which we fortunately were able to attend. We traveled with all of our PPE and tried to minimize our risk of exposure as much as possible. It would have been nice to be at the 12-week appointment, but we knew there would have to be some compromises on what we could and could not do, especially since this pregnancy was happening during the pandemic, and in another state. I feel that even without COVID, it is really hard to feel truly connected to the pregnancy milestones when you are not the one who is pregnant. I felt like I couldn’t “nest” because I am missing the physical part of carrying the baby. We are approaching 30 weeks in a few days, which is a huge milestone – and still, it is a distant feeling of excitement when you are not able to do it on your own. I must admit, this part of the journey has been a constant challenge for me. How has your birth plan changed because of COVID? Before the pandemic hit, we had a scheduled c-section planned. When we discussed the details with our surrogate’s health care provider, she let us know that during a c-section, only one person is allowed in the room. However, we were also informed that for special circumstances there is SOME flexibility and sometimes both intended parents are allowed to be present in the room for the birth. Now with COVID, those special circumstances are unfortunately few and far between. My husband and I both feel the desire to share this experience together, with our surrogate, since this is the one milestone we can actually participate in together. Not knowing if he will be able to be in the delivery room with us makes my husband and I feel like we are being stripped of our rights as parents. For us to not witness the most important moment of our lives together would be devastating. What are you most anxious or nervous about? I am most fearful that my husband and I will not have the opportunity to share the special moment and beautiful experience of our first child being born. At this point in time, my surrogate has chosen me to be the one person that she has in the room with her and we hope that on the day of the c-section they will allow for us to both be present. We surely will not give up without a fight! What advice do you have for other families considering surrogacy during COVID? While there are many ups and downs and compromises to be made, don’t push off your dreams of becoming a parent because of the pandemic… Nothing in life worth working for is easy, and in the end, the risk is very much worth the reward!

    "content": "Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra announced they welcomed their first baby, a girl, via a surrogate according to People Magazine. Both proud new parents posted this sweet message on their Instagram pages: “We are overjoyed to confirm that we have welcomed a baby via surrogate. We respectfully ask for privacy during this special time as we focus on our family. Thank you so much.” For 25 years we have experienced first-hand how surrogacy fulfills dreams and we are overjoyed for the happy family! Congratulations! What is Surrogacy? Many of you may be asking what is surrogacy and how did that help Nick and Priyanka grow their family. Surrogacy is a modern and growing means of bringing new life into the world, where a woman carries a baby for another person or a couple. The intended parents undergo IVF meaning fertilization outside of the body, to transfer their embryo into the surrogate’s uterus. A surrogate, or gestational carrier, is a woman who carries a baby for an individual or a couple that has no genetic relationship to her. Our job as a surrogacy agency is to help find and match a surrogate and intended family who have shared values and expectations. More and more families like Nick and Priyanka are turning to surrogacy as a successful option to help build their family. Many celebrities from Kim Kardashian to Neil Patrick Harris have chosen to partner with a surrogate to make their family dreams come true. And it’s not just celebrities. In 2019, surrogates were part of 5.4% of all in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. Why? It is the most successful treatment for infertility, with a 75% success rate. That number can increase as high as 95% for a birth once the gestational carrier is pregnant. Watch fertility expert Dr. Robby Setton of Shady Grove Fertility in New York talk about how surrogacy has been normalized. Who Needs A Surrogate? As a surrogate, you can give the gift of family to people who otherwise couldn’t have a child of their own. Dr. Jennifer Hirshfeld-Cytron from Fertility Centers of Illinois shared reasons why people may need a surrogate. Reasons to use a surrogate range from individuals who are struggling with infertility or with medical history such as a hysterectomy or cancer, or members of the gay community. Whether you are an intended parent looking to find the right surrogate for you or a woman thinking about becoming a surrogate to help people fulfill their dream of parenthood, the first step is learning more about the process to become a surrogate. We have compiled important facts about surrogacy in our blog Everything You Need To Know About Surrogacy. The emotional appeal, though, is the real growth story of this modern approach to building families. Anderson Cooper delivered a beautiful tribute to the power of surrogacy that you can find here.

    "content": "Surrogacy From A Surrogate Husband’s Point of View Becoming a surrogate is a personal decision and one that changes the lives of both the intended family and her own family. At ConceiveAbilities, our research shows that the number one influencer for a surrogate embarking on a surrogacy journey is her partner. Having a supporting husband or partner throughout a surrogacy journey is essential. Understandably, your significant other might have apprehensions about their wife wanting to become a surrogate. So, how do you start the conversation? Jonathan Compton and his wife Laci had been married for a few years when she first expressed interest in becoming a surrogate. Jonathan, an active duty US Airforce airman in Alaska, candidly shares how he and Laci decided surrogacy was the right path for their family and how it changed their life. What was your family situation when Laci told you she wanted to be a surrogate? “We had had our first child Lila when Laci expressed an interest in being a surrogate. We had been married two or three years. We took a pause on surrogacy, though, due to deciding to have another child of our own. We picked things back up a few years later when both our children were a little bit older. Because it was something we had discussed early in our marriage and the time was right for our family, it wasn’t a surprise when she reached out to ConceiveAbilities to begin her surrogacy journey.” Are there any misconceptions or fears about the surrogacy process you needed to gain knowledge about to feel comfortable with Laci starting the process? “I honestly did not understand how the surrogate process worked early on. I knew the child would not be ours genetically. So I became very familiar with the entire IVF process. Giving shots was a small hurdle but nothing big. Laci was better about it than I was. I think a second part of this question is that I was initially hesitant in telling our families what we were doing, because going through pregnancy for another couple rather than bringing another child to the family seemed controversial. Most of the family was very supportive in this journey and, those that had questions about it, mainly did not know what it was. Once we informed them the child would not have our genetic material, they were relieved and became accepting of the idea.” From your perspective, how was the surrogacy pregnancy different from Laci’s other pregnancies? “Surrogacy pregnancy was special because Laci was able to carry and deliver a baby for another family. I know that is very basic. Throughout the pregnancy, our intended parents’ encouragement and excitement was very uplifting and gave reason and purpose to why we were doing this.” Were you anxious about the delivery? What was your role in the delivery process? “We were given the opportunity to deliver in a very nice labor and delivery center. I admire Laci’s passion for birth and delivery, and have been able to take part in her three deliveries alongside nursing and midwifery staff. We did prep work for the delivery so, as a husband and partner to Laci, I could help keep the course of our birth plan and hopefully brought a little comfort along the way.” Does your family have a relationship with the surro-babe family? “At the time of pregnancy and delivery, we were lucky to live not too far away from the intended parents, in relative terms for the surro-world. Our families have gotten together multiple times as friends as they were only a few hours drive away. We have moved since due to career changes, but we stay in close contact and get many pictures of the chubby cheeked little baby boy that Laci helped to bring into the world.” What are the top things you would tell someone who is unsure about his/her partner becoming a surrogate? “Communication is really going to be huge through the whole journey, starting in the beginning all the way to the end. Explore the parts of the surrogacy that make you unsure. It is a different path than most people take so it is going to beg questions. I really appreciated the interactions with ConceiveAbilities’ staff members. They had a lot of experience with many couples and surrogate journeys. They always encouraged us to do what was best and right in our minds when it came to the whole process. One thing that helped me early on was remembering Laci had a yearning to help another family to become as complete as we are in our own lives. Knowing that she had a desire to help others was always the root of why she decided to be a surrogate, and I did not want to stop her pursuit.” How did your wife becoming a surrogate change your life? “Not only was it magical for Laci, it was a huge life changing event for myself and our family. Our daughters are so proud that their mom was a surrogate who gave the greatest gift you can give. I am excited to help other partners navigate surrogacy and share what I learned on the Surrogacy Learning Center.” Have more questions? Please do contact us to talk more.

    "content": "By now, we’re all aware that COVID-19 vaccines are being actively administered to priority groups throughout the United States. While this is hopefully great news to curb the effects of the pandemic, there are a variety of views about vaccination. Should I Get Vaccinated if I am Pregnant or Going To Be Pregnant? If you’re a surrogate, will the COVID-19 vaccine be safe for you and the baby you are or will be carrying? If you are an intended parent, do you want the surrogate you are working with to be vaccinated, or not be vaccinated? What if the relationship between surrogates and intended parents is strained by these uncertainties and differences of view? How will new variations of the coronavirus be impacted by these vaccines? If you want a vaccination, are you eligible and when can you receive it? Should you receive two doses, one dose or a partial dose? To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate There are no easy answers to the questions surfacing around COVID-19 vaccines, and it’s okay if your opinion differs from someone else’s. Following the steps below, though, may help surrogates and intended parents alike find ways to collaborate effectively in this very important decision-making process. Have a Conversation First, we always encourage honest and respectful dialogue between intended parents and surrogates. Ideally, a conversation will help you to understand each others’ perspectives better and perhaps allow you to come to an agreement. If you need help figuring out how to broach this topic or share your thoughts, reach out to your match manager for guidance. Talk to Your Doctor Keep in mind that this is a medical issue. While there may be unknowns associated with the COVID vaccines, some studies show there may be heightened risks for pregnant women who contract COVID. As a result, it’s very important to talk to your fertility doctor or OB as you gather information about this decision. Hearing your doctor’s best recommendation may be all that you need to feel much more clear and comfortable about the best course of action. Review the Recommendations While there is limited data about these vaccines in the context of pregnancy, there are thoughtful statements that are publicly available from some of the leading experts in the field. Click on the links below to see the most recent statements from the following organizations: American Society of Reproductive Medicine The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists The Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine’s statement of December 1, 2020 Here’s one great decision aid that brings it all together, brought to you by the experts at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Validate your Options Finally, since vaccinations are being managed by state and local health authorities, there is tremendous variation in both the availability and process to receiving a vaccination. Do your research online and with the medical professionals that are supporting your journey to find out what vaccines are available near you and what steps you would need to take to receive one. If you do decide to move forward with vaccination and meet the eligibility criteria, please follow all instructions diligently, including dosage amounts and timing. And continue to diligently practice safe public health practices, including mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing and all local and CDC guidance. While vaccinations can be a complex and thorny issue, especially during these unprecedented days of the coronavirus pandemic, we encourage intended parents and surrogates to have open dialogue, seek the best advice of medical professionals, including your doctor, and validate your options.

    "content": "2020 has been a year full of ups and downs for most of us. As this hectic year comes to a close, follow along in Ashley’s journey, as she navigates towards the birth of her first baby. Ashley and her husband are expecting their son this spring, with a little help from their long-distance surrogate! Join us as we discuss the topics you want to talk about; deciding on surrogacy during a pandemic, what it is like to have a long distance surrogate, and how to talk about your infertility struggles with your family and friends during the holidays… And, perhaps most importantly, learning to be there for yourself through life’s hard moments. But before we dive in, let’s get to know Ashley, our mom-to-be! Tell us about yourself! My name is Ashley Katzen and I am 33 years old. I live in Miami Beach, FL with my husband of 2 years. I own a Talent Acquisition agency that specializes in hiring, staffing, and recruiting in the fashion industry. In my free time, I focus on giving back to the pancreatic cancer community, as I tragically lost my mother to this disease 9 years ago. Both my husband and I love to travel and explore the world! We are absolutely in love with where we live and look forward to building our family here. Can you describe your infertility struggle? When did you first find out you would be unable to carry? At 16 years old I was diagnosed with vaginal agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. My mother was concerned that I had not gotten my period, so we went to the OB for a checkup. To everyone’s surprise, our doctor noticed that there was an absence of my vaginal canal. We then proceeded with an ultrasound and learned that I did have my eggs, but that my uterus and cervix were missing, as well. During that time, I had to make a very difficult decision with my mother on whether or not I was going to surgically create a vaginal canal, or choose dilator treatment, which is done independently. I followed my doctor’s recommendation and spent over a year independently using dilators. The main disadvantage is that it required using a dilator 3 times a day (different sizes as I progressed through my journey) for 20 minutes at a time (on a bicycle seat) until eventually, the vaginal canal was stretched to a normal length. I really did not know pain and discomfort until that experience. I also did not understand the magnitude of how difficult it would be – both emotionally and physically – when it came time to have kids. I do, however, remember thinking that nothing would have been worse than that experience. As I got older and had boyfriends, I had to explain my situation with not being able to get pregnant, and many of them were not too accepting. News also started to get around about my situation in high school, and people doubted my gender and whether or not I was born a female. The struggle was unimaginable at such a young age, but it truly prepared me for IVF and my surrogacy journey. How did you decide to choose surrogacy… What did you try before, and why was surrogacy the right decision for you? Knowing that I had viable eggs, it was never not an option for me to have children that were genetically mine. At one point in time I explored the idea of having a uterus transplant, but the success rate was low with a lot of still born babies and, therefore, I always knew that surrogacy was the route I would go. How did you decide on a surrogacy agency? I did a lot of research. I called and interviewed many agencies in advance of choosing ConceiveAbilities. There were many factors that weighed in on the decision-making process, for example: fees, support teams, reputation, knowledge, attitude, and organization. After getting to know the team at ConceiveAbilities, and their level of organization, efficiency, attention to detail and structure, I knew that it was the right agency for us. What have you learned about yourself throughout this journey? I thought that the most difficult part of this journey for me would be IVF, but I learned VERY quickly that not carrying my own child (while there are many benefits) is by far the hardest part… You feel totally out of control, guilty, separated, disconnected, and negligent. Sometimes, it doesn’t even feel like it’s happening. However, though this journey I learned that it is OK to give up control. I learned to be more patient and understanding. My superstar surrogate taught me how to trust her by really including me every step of the way. Most importantly, I learned that I simply could not expect people to understand what I was going through, especially if they hadn’t gone through it. I became extremely sad and frustrated any time I had expectations of the way I wanted to receive support from people. I eventually learned how to be there for myself. I never thought I could do that. But I can, and I am. Join our Surrogacy Learning Center to continue the conversation – CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP TODAY!

    "content": "COVID has impacted every facet of our lives, including medical care. As you embark on your surrogacy journey during this unprecedented time, COVID-19 brings new challenges. And still for many people, it has inspired more determination than ever to find a path to building their family. Fertility Specialist and Reproductive Endocrinologist read Dr. Marie Werner from RMA New Jersey joined All Things Conceivable: A Surrogacy Podcast with Nazca Fontes to share what she’s learned about caring for her surrogacy patients during the global pandemic. Dr. Werner’s experience is particularly insightful as RMA New Jersey, like ConceiveAbilities, has remained open and active in guiding surrogacy journeys continuously through 2020. Listen to the full episode. And, read on for a quick take on Dr. Werner’s perspective. NF: How is COVID-19 impacting the surrogacy journey?“From the beginning, our practice really had a strong commitment to our patients and we know that fertility doesn’t wait. Building a family doesn’t wait, no matter really what’s going on in the world. We stayed open through it all and we have a really efficient system in place to make sure our patients feel that we’re doing everything in our power to limit exposure for every piece of the journey. There are always risks involved and it’s really important that our patients are aware of those risks before proceeding. Our patients have been very understanding of [our safety procedures] and I am appreciative of our relationship with our patients to get them to that point, because all of this is so emotional.” NF: Even though ASRM initially recommended pausing treatment back in March 2020, RMA New Jersey did not shut down during COVID. Why were you able to stay open?“I have a lot of respect for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. In such uncertain times, they were trying their best to offer patients the best guidance that they could. We have to remember that not every fertility center is the same. At the end of the day, patient autonomy is really important, especially when we’re talking about a situation where we know eggs don’t wait for us. We feel like fertility treatment is essential. Building a family is essential and we couldn’t take that away from the patients.” NF: What have you learned about surrogacy care during COVID-19?“Medical professionals, fertility providers and agencies like ConceiveAbilities are all working together to make sure we’re making this the safest journey possible, but we can’t eliminate all risks. I would encourage all these patients to have frank discussions with providers about their fears, their anxieties, so they can help manage those. The most important thing in all of this is communication and counseling. As long as you feel like your team is supporting you in those ways, you should move forward. Because again, time is not on our side when it comes to these treatments and we want you to have your family now, not a few years down the line.” NF: Is it safe to conceive during COVID-19?“Information is limited since we have only been dealing with this for the past ten months. The literature the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has put out says that it is still safe to conceive. No one is telling anybody not to conceive, but we are telling pregnant patients that they are considered a higher risk population and the CDC just updated that guideline as well. It is important for everybody to know that is the case and to try to limit exposures as much as possible.” NF: Should people wait to move forward with their surrogacy journey?“I don’t think waiting makes a ton of sense, given we just don’t know what will happen next. Even if COVID-19 goes away, there could be another virus next year, so I would encourage all of my patients to continue moving forward. And so while life is not perfect, I think that we have appropriate ways to manage care from a medical aspect where I don’t think people should be waiting to start this process.” NF: What has been your “aha” moment during Covid?“At the beginning of the pandemic when we kept our doors open, you saw all these lawn signs everywhere supporting our essential workers with a picture of the physician, the nurse, or the policemen. I got a small present delivered to the office from one of my patients that said, ‘Thank you for being an essential worker.’ I learned how important it is that we’re here and doing this everyday for our patients and continue to be here for them. I am really thankful for that patient for putting it into words, because that’s how we’ve been acting. We will keep our doors open and we’ll continue to help patients build their families without waiting and I think that’s the most important take home message. I don’t know how things are going to change, but we’re certainly always going to be at the forefront of making sure we provide our patients with evidence-based practices. A big part of that is realizing that fertility is an essential service and that we’re going to be here for them.” Have more questions? Please find more answers here, and do contact us to talk more.

    "content": "We often hear from both intended parents and surrogates that they would like to offer one another a symbol of hope and gratitude to mark the moments of their shared journey. These mementos may be shared at transfer day, during pregnancy, after the birth – and a special holiday like Mothers Day! They can range from homemade tokens to gift baskets to personalized items tailored specifically to the recipient. These are some of the creative gifts we have seen shared between intended parents and surrogates over the years. We hope they provide some inspiration for you! Jewelry Ideas If jewelry holds special meaning, we love the simplicity of this Kate Spade “heart of gold” bangle bracelet. You can also personalize your sentiments with a Giving Key necklace, bracelet, or earrings. For a unique twist, embrace the journey and choose from an array of jewelry with charms specific to fertility (think pineapples) from vendors like Alex and Ani or Luca and Danni. Sentimental Ideas If sentimentality is more your style, we suggest a combined surrogacy pregnancy journal as a way for you to all contribute to the pregnancy and birth story. A small figurine can serve as a daily reminder of why you’re pursuing this process together, and a keychain etched with the sound waves from the baby’s heartbeat can help minimize the miles between you. There are also unique prints that can be customized to represent where the surrogate lives, where the transfer occurred, and where the IPs live. And of course, some say a book can be the best gift. Take a look through our list of timeless surrogacy books. You just may find the perfect one for your surrogacy journey. Homemade Ideas As our #10 idea, we have a catchall category here to memorialize the creativity of incredible homemade gifts we have seen over time, whether thoughtfully customized onesies for the new addition(s), or gorgeously cozy quilts and knitted items. IPs sometimes create a post-transfer or post-birth gift basket for their surrogate full of their favorite snacks, books, and movies. Some surrogates have created a “Welcome to Parenthood” basket with items the IPs and baby won’t be able to live without. And don’t think that you need to spend a great deal to make an impact. We often hear that some of the most meaningful exchanges have been a heartfelt, handwritten letter or a sweet framed photo. You know your match best, and we encourage you to have fun with your gift-giving. If you need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out to your ConceiveAbilities team. Happy gifting!",

    "content": "Finding a path to parenthood by working with a gestational carrier continues to grow in its appeal. Surrogacy by the numbers In 2019, more than 10,000 births took place by surrogate in the United States, and the market is steadily growing at 15% per year based on data from the Centers for Disease Control. And, in 2019, 5.4% of all In Vitro Fertilization transfers occurred with a gestational carrier, which is up from just over 1% ten years prior. Surrogacy in the news The emotional appeal, though, is the real growth story of this modern approach to building families. Just last week, Anderson Cooper delivered a beautiful tribute to the power of surrogacy. Listen and watch his gripping commendation on CNN here. Anderson is the latest public face to share his feelings about how surrogacy has made his life more than he could have ever imagined. And we add our warmest welcome to Anderson’s newborn Wyatt. But there’s more. Andy Cohen, of Watch What Happens Live and Radio Andy, turned his joy in becoming a father with the help of a surrogate into passionate and effective advocacy to legalize compensated gestational surrogacy in New York. And, after a hard-fought battle, he and the great state of New York prevailed, as state-of-the-art legislation was just passed. Finally, for anyone who is finding the journey to parenthood to be challenging, hear from Jimmy Fallon and his wife Nancy Juvonen. Just last week, they shared their candid and raw emotions about what their path to parenthood involved. Jimmy and Nancy’s young daughters, both delivered via surrogate, are now routinely featured in The Tonight Show’s At Home Edition. Draw inspiration from Nancy’s words, amid the couple’s banter, as she describes her decision and determination to simply not quit, which made their beautiful family possible. Be a surrogate And, if you’ve ever thought that you could make that kind of miraculous difference for someone else, we encourage you to consider the possibilities. You can take a look at the process to get a better understanding of how to be a surrogate. But, even better, you can also talk with us. We know what it takes to be a surrogate and we know the difference you could make.",
