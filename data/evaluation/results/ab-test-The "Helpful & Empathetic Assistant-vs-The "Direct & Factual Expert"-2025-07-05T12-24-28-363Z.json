This could be a personal goal or part of a team effort.\n- **Impact**: Donated breast milk is crucial for babies who are unable to receive milk from their own mothers, as it provides essential nutrients and antibodies.\n- **Involvement**: ConceiveAbilities encourages their community, including surrogates, egg donors, and intended parents, to participate and make a difference.\n\nFor more details, you can visit the ConceiveAbilities website or contact their team directly.

      "configA": {
        "answer": "That's a wonderful question! Becoming a surrogate is a significant and rewarding decision, and it's important to consider several factors carefully. Here are some key points to think about, based on the information available from ConceiveAbilities:\n\n1. **Understand the Process**: Familiarize yourself with the surrogacy journey, including medical, legal, and emotional aspects. ConceiveAbilities provides comprehensive information on their website to help you understand what to expect.\n\n2. **Eligibility**: Ensure you meet the basic requirements to become a surrogate. Typically, these include:\n   - Being between the ages of 21 and 44\n   - Having had at least one successful pregnancy and delivery\n   - Being in good physical and mental health\n   - Not using any illegal drugs, smoking, or abusing alcohol\n\n3. **Support System**: Consider your personal support system. Surrogacy can be emotionally and physically demanding, so having supportive friends, family, and a understanding partner can be crucial.\n\n4. **Legal and Financial Aspects**: Understand the legal and financial implications of surrogacy. ConceiveAbilities works with legal professionals to ensure all parties are protected, and they provide compensation to surrogates for their time and efforts.\n\n5. **Emotional Readiness**: Reflect on your emotional readiness. Being a surrogate involves carrying a child for someone else, which can bring up complex emotions. It's important to feel comfortable with the idea of giving the baby to the intended parents after birth.\n\n6. **Agency Support**: Consider working with a reputable agency like ConceiveAbilities. They provide guidance, support, and resources throughout the surrogacy process.\n\n7. **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask questions. ConceiveAbilities is there to support you and provide the information you need to make an informed decision.\n\nIf you're considering becoming a surrogate, I encourage you to visit the ConceiveAbilities website to learn more about their program and the support they offer.

For surrogates, this amount is typically higher to account for the longer process and physical demands.\n- **Additional Compensation**: This can include allowances for:\n  - Travel and expenses\n  - Maternity clothing\n  - Childcare\n  - Lost wages (if applicable)\n  - Embryo transfer fees\n  - Medical expenses not covered by insurance\n- **Bonus Payments**: Some agencies, including ConceiveAbilities, offer bonus payments for specific milestones, such as completing certain stages of the process successfully.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, I would recommend visiting the ConceiveAbilities website and contacting their team directly.
