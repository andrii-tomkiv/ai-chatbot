What Matching Matters™ Means for Parents and Surrogates Matching Matters is ConceiveAbilities’ proprietary matching process and system to make great matches between surrogates and the families they help. Our approach is designed to match surrogates and intended parents based on the relationship goals each party has for one another, the medical criteria of the intended parents’ fertility center and legal considerations, and other criteria that each party views as important.

The principles we prioritize in Matching Matters™ are based on relationship compatibility, medical criteria of the intended parents’ clinic, and other specifics requested by the surrogate and the intended parents. Our experts take into account all aspects of the surrogacy process to thoroughly vet compatibility. You Define and Choose Your Relationship Our surrogacy process takes into account your comfort level with contact. Based on the wants and needs of each party, identifying the right match for the right set of personalities and needs is essential for success. Some surrogates and their intended parents text every day, while other relationships have more defined boundaries. Some surrogates and intended parents continue to have contact after the birth, and others wish each other well and move on. Here’s the good news: your relationship during the surrogacy process is yours to define. And, there is room for it to evolve and change as the journey continues. You decide. Finding Your Surrogacy Match We will present you with a curated, carefully vetted profile of a potential match, so you can learn about the family you choose to help. The result? The right match the first time, helping you move closer to your dream of building a family. Cultivating a Meaningful Surrogacy Partnership Throughout Your Surrogacy Journey We provide surrogates and intended parents with a shared decision making framework to build a strong relationship and dedicated professionals to help navigate the difficult conversations that are part of every surrogacy journey. And, ConceiveAbilities is there to guide and help you through each step. Why Does Matching Matter™? So what does this all mean for you? It means ConceiveAbilities has scrutinized every step and stage of the surrogacy process, innovated and tweaked it at every level, and tested it rigorously to ensure high-quality, compatible matches and experiences. Surrogacy matches are part science and part art, and we’re confident that no other agency has the same standards and success as ConceiveAbilities in making great matches. 97% Match Success With other agencies, the matching process can result in “false starts” and cause headaches for parents and surrogates alike from these miscues. Matching Matters™ results in a 97% match on the first presentation. Surrogates have an opportunity to view the profiles of prospective matches, and so do intended parents. With your input and our know-how, we make matches that move journeys forward. Shortened Timeline Precise surrogate matching process means shortened timeline and rewarding relationships. The extensive measures we take ensure that your investment of time, finances and emotion are protected. We commit to connecting each surrogate with the family they were meant to help. In surrogacy engagements with less experienced agencies or independently managed, the journey may take years and, due to the complexity of every surrogacy process, may simply never be able to start. With our Matching Matters, you are able to move forward steadily, because we know how to proactively move each party through the necessary milestones quickly and effectively in a way that forges a strong match. We place significant investment and expertise in understanding the interpersonal and psychological profiles of each individual. When we recommend a match, therefore, we have high certainty that it will be the right one, which reduces wasted time and resources. Screening Our screenings aren’t just a box to tick off, they’re a key stage in our process. We work very hard to ensure surrogates can pass the respective fertility clinic’s criteria; in fact, 95% of our surrogates receive fertility clinic clearance. For surrogates and intended parents alike, the rigor of our screening process helps ensure that your investment of time and emotion is honored and secured. Equally important, matching at ConceiveAbilities is based on understanding the fundamental motivations and context behind the surrogacy arrangement. Who are the people involved? What is their background and their life experiences? What is life at home like? What is their vision for the surrogacy experience? These questions are vital to getting to know each surrogate and each intended parent, so that matches will be compatible. Local Matching Matters™ We know that geographic proximity between intended parents, surrogates and fertility clinics throughout your surrogacy journey might be important to you – for convenience, relationship building and peace of mind. We honor that desire, and because of our reach and popularity in communities across the country, we can address that need. You may find, in your matching process, that factors other than geographic proximity become more important to you. We see great success in both local and long distance surrogacy journeys.
